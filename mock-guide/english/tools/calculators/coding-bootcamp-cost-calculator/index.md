### Notes:
<ol>
  <li>
    We assumed an APR of 6% and a term of 3 years. If you happen
    to have around $15,000 in cash set aside for a coding
    bootcamp, please ignore this cost.
  </li>
  <li>
    We assume a cost of living of $500 for cities like San
    Francisco and New York City, and $400 per week for
    everywhere else.
  </li>
  <li>
    The most substantial cost for most people is lost wages. A
    40-hour-per-week job at the US Federal minimum wage would
    pay at least $15,000 per year. You can read more about
