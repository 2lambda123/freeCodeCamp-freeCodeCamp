Welcome to freeCodeCamp's open source codebase and curriculum!
=======================

freeCodeCamp is a friendly open source community where you learn to code and help nonprofits.

**We help our campers build job-worthy portfolios of real apps used by real people, while helping nonprofits.**

You start by working through our self-paced, browser-based full stack JavaScript curriculum.

### By working through our new and updated curriculum and completing the required projects, you can earn six certifications. Each of these certificates will have 5 required projects, and all other challenges will be optional.      We estimate that each certificate will take around 300 hours to complete.


##### 1. Responsive Web Design

**Add links to the live demos of your projects as you finish them. Then, once you have added all 5 projects required for a certification, you can claim it.**
a. Build A Tribute Page
b. Build A Survey Form
c. Build A Product Landing Page
d. Build A Technical Documentation Page
e. Build A Personal Portfolio Webpage

##### 2. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

**To complete this certification, you must first complete the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures project challenges**
a. Palindrome Checker
b. Roman Numeral Converter
c. Caesars Cipher
d. Telephone Number Validator
e. Cash Register

##### 3. Front End Libraries

**Add links to the live demos of your projects as you finish them.**
a. Build A Random Quote Machine
b. Build A Markdown Previewer
c. Build A Drum Machine
d. Build A Java Script Calculator
e. Build A Pomodoro Clock

##### 4. Data Visualization

**Add links to the live demos of your projects as you finish them.**
a. Visualize Data With A Bar Chart
b. Visualize Data With A Scatterplot Graph
c. Visualize Data With A Heat Map
d. Visualize Data With A Choropleth Map
e. Visualize Data With A Treemap Diagram

##### 5. APIs and Microservices

**Add links to the live demos of your projects as you finish them.**
a. Timestamp Microservice
b. Request Header Parser Microservice
c. URL Shortener Microservice
d. Exercise Tracker
e. File Metadata Microservice

##### 6. Information Security and Quality Assurance

**Add links to the live demos of your projects as you finish them.**
a. Metric Imperial Converter
b. Issue Tracker
c. Personal Library
d. Stock Price Checker
e. Anonymous Message Board

**Once you earn all 6 of these certificates, we’ll award you with the freeCodeCamp Full Stack Development Certificate. This final distinction signifies that you’ve completed around 1,800 hours of coding with a wide range of web development tools.**


###These six new certifications will replace the old legacy certificates:

**Legacy Front End Development**
**Legacy Data Visualization**
**Legacy Back End Development**

###Coding for nonprofits

We’ve decided to make coding for nonprofits a separate process from the certificate program. We’ve added 5 of our projects that are used by nonprofits - our Open Source for Good projects - to the challenge map. Feel free to browse their open issues. You can dive in and start contributing whenever you feel ready.

We will continue to add Open Source for Good projects to the challenge map as they become stable and ready for your contributions. These projects are all built using the same JavaScript-based tools you’ll learn by earning the certificates. And several of these are nearing a public beta (I’ll formally announce these as they go into open beta).

In addition to our Open Source for Good projects - which are particularly well-documented and beginner-friendly - there are tons of other open source projects you can contribute to. The community has built a guide to contributing to various open source projects here 363.

###What happens to the old legacy certificates?

If you’ve already earned a certificate, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or résumé. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they’ll see a verified certificate specific to you.

And if you’ve already started working toward the Legacy Front End Development, Legacy Data Visualization, or Legacy Back End Development certificates, and still want to claim it, don’t worry - you can will always be able to claim these certificates - even after we release the beta challenges.

All of the required projects for these old certificates will remain available on freeCodeCamp. For the old certificates, you can complete old versions of the projects.

As long as you created your account before we release the expanded curriculum, you will be able to claim these old certificates any time you want, and they’ll start showing up on your freeCodeCamp profile.

Campers who create their freeCodeCamp after we release the expanded curriculum will not be able to claim these old certificates.

Note that in order to claim the new certificates, you’ll need to build the new projects (some of which are updated versions of old projects) and get all of their tests passing.

###Some cool facts about the new certificates

1. Each of these certificates has 5 projects, all of which have built-in test suites. This means that each user story has a corresponding test that can tell you when you’ve properly fulfilled it.
2. You can pull in these tests through a CDN, meaning you’ll be able to build these projects on websites like CodePen, or your local development environment, or even on freeCodeCamp.org 80 itself.
3. We love Node School but we’re getting rid of their challenges. We’ve built our own back end challenges and projects, which also have tests, and can be completed on Glitch.com 295 or your local development environment.
4. We still recommend completing all of these certificates, but if you are already an experienced developer, it will be much easier for you to learn a specific skill you’re interested (like information security) without having to jump around through the map. All the topics will be broken out in as modular a way as possible.
