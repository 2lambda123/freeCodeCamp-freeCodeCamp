Welcome to freeCodeCamp's open source codebase and curriculum!
=======================

freeCodeCamp is a friendly open source community where you learn to code and help nonprofits.

**We help our campers build job-worthy portfolios of real apps used by real people, while helping nonprofits.**

You start by working through our self-paced, browser-based full stack JavaScript curriculum.

By working through our new and updated curriculum and completing the required projects, you can earn six certifications. Each of these certificates will have 5 required projects, and all other challenges will be optional. We estimate that each certificate will take around 300 hours to complete.


##### 1. Responsive Web Design

Add links to the live demos of your projects as you finish them. Then, once you have added all 5 projects required for a certification, you can claim it.**

Once you earn all 6 of these certificates, we’ll award you with the freeCodeCamp Full Stack Development Certificate. This final distinction signifies that you’ve completed around 1,800 hours of coding with a wide range of web development tools.


<strong>These six new certifications will replace the old legacy certificates:</strong>

- Legacy Front End Development
- Legacy Data Visualization
- Legacy Back End Development


<strong>What happens to the old legacy certificates?</strong>

If you’ve already earned a certificate, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or résumé. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they’ll see a verified certificate specific to you.

And if you’ve already started working toward the Legacy Front End Development, Legacy Data Visualization, or Legacy Back End Development certificates, and still want to claim it, don’t worry - you can will always be able to claim these certificates.
All of the required projects for these old certificates will remain available on freeCodeCamp.


<strong>Some cool facts about the new certificates</strong>

- Each of these certificates has 5 projects, all of which have built-in test suites. This means that each user story has a corresponding test that can tell you when you’ve properly fulfilled it.
- You can pull in these tests through a CDN, meaning you’ll be able to build these projects on websites like CodePen, or your local development environment.
- We’ve built our own back end challenges and projects.
- We still recommend working your way through the challenges, but if you would like to learn a specific skill you’re interested in, feel free to skip ahead. All of the certifications can be completed in isolation, we do not lock off parts of the curriculum whilst earlier parts are incomplete.
