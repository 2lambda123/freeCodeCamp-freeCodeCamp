Adding the feature to /pair-coding to allow users to collabarate and pair program.

When someone is free and want to pair up to dual code they could go 'online'. They could either A)list what they were working on with 'tags' such as 'node', 'express', 'mongo', 'bonfires', etc so other people could see them or B) search/browse other people.

I feel like this would help stimulate the community and provide a catalyst for learning
