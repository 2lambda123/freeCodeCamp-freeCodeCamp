### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org provides a range of free developer certifications. Each certification requires you to complete 5 web app projects and numerous optional coding challenges, offering around 300 hours of learning for each beginner programmer.

These projects come with agile user stories and automated tests to help you build your project incrementally. You can access the test suites via [freeCodeCamp's CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This allows you to build these projects on platforms like CodePen, Replit, or your local development environment.

Once you earn a certification, it's yours to keep and showcase on your LinkedIn or resume, making you stand out to potential employers or freelance clients.
