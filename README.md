## freeCodeCamp.org's open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp's CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer's development environment.

Once you've earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they'll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

Here are our ten core certifications:

### How to Contribute

### Contribute by answering coding questions
1. There are a wide range of questions and topics on our site to contribute to. 
Read more at: https://forum.freecodecamp.org/

2. Give feedback on coding projects built by campers
Our goal is to develop a fun and clear interactive learning experience.

Designing interactive coding challenges is difficult. It would be much easier to write a lengthy explanation or to create a video tutorial. But for our core curriculum, we're sticking with what works best for most people - a fully interactive, video game-like experience.

We want campers to achieve a flow state. We want them to build momentum and blast through our curriculum with as few snags as possible. We want them to go into the projects with confidence and gain a wide exposure to programming concepts.

Note that for Version 7.0 of the freeCodeCamp curriculum, we are moving toward an entirely project-focused model with a lot more repetition.
Creating these challenges requires immense creativity and attention to detail. There's plenty of help available. You'll have support from a whole team of contributors to whom you can bounce ideas off and demo your challenges.

And as always, feel free to ask questions on the 'Contributors' category on our forum or the contributors chat room.

With your help, we can design an interactive coding curriculum that will help millions of people learn to code for years to come.
The content for each challenge is stored in its markdown file. This markdown file is later converted to HTML using our tools to create interactive web pages.
You can find all of freeCodeCamp.org's curricular content in the /curriculum/challenges directory.

### Help us translate freeCodeCamp.org's resources

We are localizing freeCodeCamp.org to major world languages.
Certifications are already live in some major world languages like Chinese (中文), Spanish (Español), Italian (Italiano), Portuguese (Português). We encourage you to read the announcement here and share it with your friends to get them excited about this.

It's our dream to provide you with the resources to learn, no matter the world language you speak. To help us with this massive effort, we have integrated our open-source code-base & curriculum with Crowdin - A tool to help us localize our code-base.

The translation workflow is split into two main activities:

•	Translating curriculum files, documentation and UI elements like buttons, labels, etc.:
As a translator you can sign up on our translation platform and contribute translations in any of the 30+ languages enabled in there.

•	Proofreading the translations for all of the above.
Proofreaders verify that the community contributed translations are uniform in tone and free of common issues like typos, etc. In short, they ensure that the quality of translations is high. Note that we do not use machine translations for a reason.

### Contribute to the curriculum

Our curriculum is curated by the global freeCodeCamp community. This way, we are able to incorporate expert knowledge from volunteers like you.

You can help expand and improve the curriculum. You can also update project user stories to better-explain concepts. And you can improve our automated tests so that we can more accurately test people's code.

### Set up the tooling for the curriculum
Before you work on the curriculum, you would need to set up some tooling to help you test your changes. You can use any option from the below:

•	You can set up freeCodeCamp locally. This is highly recommended for regular/repeat contributions. This setup allows you to work and test your changes.

•	Use Gitpod, a free online dev environment. Clicking the button below will start a ready-to-code dev environment for freeCodeCamp in your browser. It only takes a few minutes.

•	Edit the files on GitHub's interface by clicking the pencil icon for the corresponding file. While this is the quickest way, It is not recommended, because you are unable to test your changes on GitHub. If our maintainers conclude that the changes you made need to be tested locally, you would need to follow the methods above instead.
