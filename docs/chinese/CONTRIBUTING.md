## Contribute to this open source codebase

We have a huge open source codebase of the thousands of [coding challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org) and [guide articles](https://guide.freecodecamp.org).

You can help us:

- [📝 Research, Write and Update our guide articles](#research-write-and-update-our-guide-articles)

- [💻 Create, Update and Fix Bugs in our coding challenges](#create-update-and-fix-bugs-in-our-coding-challenges)

- [🌐 Translate guide articles and coding challenges](#translate-guide-articles-and-coding-challenges)

- [🛠 Help us fix bugs in freeCodeCamp.org's learning platform](#help-us-fix-bugs-in-freecodecamporgs-learning-platform)

### Research, Write and Update our guide articles

**什么是指导文章?**

Guide articles help you get a quick understanding of a technology concept. These are short, plain-English explanations that you can read before going on to more in-depth resources.

You can find an [example article about HTML Anchor Elements here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/client/src/pages/guide/english/html/elements/a-tag/index.md).

**如果我要写文章，应该写关于什么项目?**

We welcome your help writing these articles. You don't have to be an expert in a topic to write about it—this entire Guide is open source, so even if you make a mistake, another contributor will eventually correct it.

To help, find a `stub article` on our [Guide website](https://guide.freecodecamp.org), write the article, then open a pull request to replace the stub with your article. A [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) is how you'll suggest changes. It lets others know about your changes, review them and adopt them.

If you can't find a stub about the topic you'd like to write about, you can open a PR that creates the stub and includes your draft article.

If you would like to help improve guide articles, here's [how to work on guide articles](/docs/how-to-work-on-guide-articles.md).

### 编造, 更新， 或者在编码挑战中找失误

All our Coding challenges are curated by the community, bringing in expert knowledge from volunteers like you.

You can help expand them and make their wording more clear. You can update the user stories to explain the concept better and even remove redundant ones. You can also improve the challenge tests to make them more accurately test people's code.

If you're interested in improving these coding challenges, here's [how to work on coding challenges](/docs/how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md).

### Translate guide articles and coding challenges

你可以帮我们翻译我们的指导文章和编码挑战成你的母语。目前为止我们已有一下这些语言的翻译:

- [Chinese (中文)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/curriculum/challenges/chinese)
- [Russian (русский)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/curriculum/challenges/russian)
- [Arabic (عربى)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/curriculum/challenges/arabic)
- [Spanish (Español)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/curriculum/challenges/spanish)
- [Portuguese (Português)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/curriculum/challenges/portuguese)

We would love your help in improving the quality of these translations. Millions of people use the English language version of freeCodeCamp.org, and we expect millions more to use these translated versions as well.

### Help us fix bugs in freeCodeCamp.org's learning platform

Our learning platform runs on a modern JavaScript stack. It has various components, tools and libraries including but not limited to Node.js, MongoDB, LoopBack, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, Webpack, and more.

Broadly,

- We have a Node.js based API server.
- A set of React based client applications.
- A script that we use to evaluate our Frontend projects.

Contributing to this requires some understanding of APIs, ES6 Syntax and a lot of curiosity.

Essentially we expect certain basic familiarity, with some of the aforementioned technologies, tools and libraries. That said, you are not required to be an expert on them.

Feel free to ask us questions, on the related issue threads, and we will be glad to clarify. When in doubt, you can reach Mrugesh Mohapatra [`@raisedadead`](https://github.com/raisedadead) or Stuart Taylor [`@bouncey`](https://github.com/bouncey) from our platform dev team to help you with this.

If you want to help us improve our codebase, here's [how to setup freeCodeCamp locally](/docs/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md).

## 经常问的问题

**How can I report a bug, that is not on board?**

If you think you've found a bug, first read the ["Help I've Found a Bug"](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-report-a-bug/19543) article and follow its instructions.

If you're confident it's a new bug, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so we can reproduce the bug. We have a pre-defined issue template to help you through this.

Please note, that any issues that seek coding help on a challenge, will be closed. The issue tracker is strictly for the codebase related issues and discussions. You should [seek assistance on the forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum) before reporting whenever in doubt.

**如何报告安全问题？**

Please don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to `security@freecodecamp.org` and we'll look into it immediately.

**I am stuck on something that is not in these documentation. How can get help?**

你可以在一下网页链接请求指导:

- [The "Contributors" category our public forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/c/contributors)
- [Our public contributors chat room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors)

We are excited to help you contribute to any of the topics that you would like to work on. Make sure you search for your query before posting a new one. Be polite and patient. Our community volunteers and moderators are always around to guide you through your queries.

**这是我第一次使用 GitHub 和 Open Source:**

Read our [How to Contribute to Open Source Guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source).

**问题上的不同标志是什么意思?**

Our community moderators [triage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Bug_management) issues and pull requests based on their priority, severity and other factors. You can [find a complete glossary of their meanings here](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/labels).

You should go through **`Help Wanted`** or **`first timers welcome`** issues for quick lookup of what is available for you to work on. These are up for grabs and you do not need a go ahead before working on these.

If these issues lack clarity on what needs to be done, feel free ask questions in the comments.

**I found a typo, should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?**

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without first creating an issue. Issues are more for discussing larger problems associated with code, or more structural aspects of the curriculum.
