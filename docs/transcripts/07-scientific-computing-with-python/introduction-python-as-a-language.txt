Introduction: Python as a Language
Transcript: 
Hello and welcome back to Python as a language you’ll notice that I’m wearing a hat um and uh part of the story of the hat is that where I work here at University of Michigan School of Information, we my office is in this building called north quad and the we call it quad worlds sometimes because it’s sort of got a square sort of imitation Oxford Quad and so it seemed to me to evoke notions of Harry Potter and when we first moved into the building I sort of joked to one of my classes that we should have a sorting ceremony for all the students as they come into North quad for the first time and so that was cool and I thought that I would belong in Gryffindor like everyone wants to be in Gryffindor right they’re the good guys and my students told me that I couldn’t be in Gryffindor that I had to be in Slytherin so you’ll see me drinking tea throughout the course out of this teacup it’s my Slytherin teacup I picked that up from harry potter world I went down to florida and visited harry potter world. The reason I was sorted by my students into Slytherin is also because I teach Python and Python is like a snake and so if you think about the people from Slytherin they are capable of talking to snakes and that class that we were doing the sorting was a Python class and so it sort of made perfect sense that you would have to be in Slytherin if you were the Python teacher and then of course that your name was Charles Severance and then that sounds kind of like Severus Snape and so I just accepted that I’m in Slytherin. S you all can be in Gryffindor but I can’t, I’m in Slytherin, so I’m the bad guy or the good guy depends on how you look at it right and so what I’m going to do now is I’m going to you know bring you into Slytherin as well because I’m going to teach you the Python language. Python is the language that we Pythonistas talk. It was invented over 20 years ago by a fellow named Guido van Rossum and away we go. 
Now even though I’m using this whole snake Slytherin thing, it turns out that Python was not at all named for Harry Potter because Python was invented almost two decades before Harry Potter was created and it wasn’t for the snake, it was actually Monty Python’s Flying Circus was the inspiration for Python -- the name Python-- and I -- because Guido van Rossum really wanted to create a programming language that while it was powerful underneath it-- in its very nature was a very powerful language he-- wanted it to be a language that was fun, and he wanted it to be a language that was approachable and so that’s why Python recently has become so absolutely popular and it’s easy to learn-- and it’s --but it’s also powerful and that’s sort of the magic of Python, the ease of learning it, the brevity of the programs, the shortness of the programs, and the power. And so we are going to become Pythonistas. 
Now, as you learn to be a software developer using the Python programming language you are going to encounter syntax errors and I remember when I used to get syntax errors and I remember my first programming class and I would type on cards and I would upload those cards to the computer and the computer would say you’re not worthy and I’m like wait a second those were pretty good cards how could you be so critical of me. You know it’d say syntax error and you know I really got a sort of a really bad attitude that somehow this computer didn’t like me and that I would make cards it would complain and I would make changes to those cards and it would still complain and make changes and it would still complain and I’m like how can I win in this situation and you’re gonna feel the same thing you’re gonna absolutely feel the same thing You’re going to be struggling, you’re going to be like how come this computer hates me? Let me assure you right now that the computer doesn’t hate you, the computer actually loves you, it just is not very good at showing how it loves you or telling you how or why it loves you. And so syntax errors are not so much Python telling you that you’re bad or that you are an inadequate programmer or that you should find something else to do it’s really Python’s admission that it doesn’t understand what you’re trying to say, and so you’ve got to get used to that and it’s frustrating but you’ve got to get used to the fact that syntax errors are your friend. Python is saying hey I got to line seven and I was doing fine until line seven but boy in line  seven there’s some little thing I don’t know what the word “else” means in this context or you didn’t indent it and I’m kind of confused what did you mean please please please help me, you know and so it’s so much easier for you to learn Python than it is for Python to figure out what you mean when you’re writing code. 
So we have a number of different ways to sort of encode our instructions when we talk to Python. One is we just run Python interactively on our computer, hopefully by now you’ve got it installed, and we just type Python at a command prompt for either  a Windows command prompt or a linux command prompt or a macintosh command prompt and I’ve got some examples of how to sort of get this all started, get Python installed and away you go. Now you’ll notice when you run the Python interpreter the three Chevron prompt, Python is asking you what next right, this is you it’s saying I want to talk to you, I want you to tell me some Python to do if you know the Python language you know what to say right here. Now if you know Python if you can type these languages you can say oh x equals one, which really means go find a little piece of memory label it x and stick one in it. Print x is like go find that thing where you labeled it x and bring me back that number and tell me what I stored in there. Now why you want to do this, that’s a different question. These are very simple things. It’s going to take a while to get the big picture of why we’re doing this so just trust me that you want to learn the statement and then later we will successfully turn those into a program. So x equals x plus one, the third line there, x equals x plus one is not as it seems in math, it basically says go grab the old value of x, add one to it, and stick it back in X, that’s what that means, so an equal sign really has kind of an arrow to it and then we say go look up that x thing that we just did and print that out and then we’re going to say quit. 
So that’s us talking to Python now you can type just about any type of crazy stuff you want in here and Python will be unhappy and talk to you so what we’re going to do next is we’re going to start talking about the actual language of Python and what it is that we have to say to make Python happy when we’re talking to it.
