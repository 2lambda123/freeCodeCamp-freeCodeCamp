# Review translation PRs (翻译校对)

This guide will cover how to review pull requests that translate freeCodeCamp challenges and projects into another language.

## Find a pull request to review

To find open translation pull requests, open <https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22language%3A+YOUR_LANGUAGE%22>, replacing `YOUR_LANGUAGE` with the language you wish to review.

This will open a list of open pull requests that have been tagged with a label for your language. However, it's possible that an open pull request wasn't tagged with a label, so you can also search for [open PRs that start with `fix(i18n):`](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+fix%28i18n%29%3A) and find one that hasn't been reviewed yet.
