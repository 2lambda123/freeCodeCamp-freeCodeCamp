## Curriculum

Our curriculum is curated by the global freeCodeCamp community. This way, we are able to incorporate expert knowledge from volunteers like you. You can help by:
- Expanding and improving the curriculum
- Updating project user stories to better-explain concepts
- Improving our automated tests to test people's code more accurately

**If you're interested in improving our curriculum, here's how: [How do I contribute to the curriculum?](how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md).**

## Learning Platform

Our learning platform runs on a modern JavaScript stack. It has various components, tools, and libraries. These include Node.js, MongoDB, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, Webpack, and more.

Broadly, we use 

- A Node.js based API server
- A set of React-based client applications
- Testing scripts to evaluate camper-submitted curriculum projects

If you want to productively contribute to the curriculum, we recommend some familiarity with these tools.
