## Curriculum

Our curriculum is curated by the global freeCodeCamp community, which enables us to incorporate knowledge and expertise from volunteers like you.

You can help expand and improve the curriculum. You can also update project user stories to explain concepts in a better manner. You can also improve our automated tests so that we can test codes from people more accurately.
