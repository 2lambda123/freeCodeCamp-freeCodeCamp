How to Contribute to FreeCodeCamp using Gitpod

This is a guide on how to use Gitpod to contribute to FreeCodeCamp.

Gitpod Introduction

Gitpod is a ready to code development enviroment that allows developers to start development directly from the browser.
It is automated and reproducible. Every branch of a repository is prebuilt so installation, cloning and building is 
not needed.

Getting Started

The button in the previous page directly opens up a Gitpod environment for FreeCodeCamp.

Alternatively, any GitHub URL can be prefixed with gitpod.io/# to start a new environment.

Any issue URL can also be prefixed with gitpod.io/# to start a new environment for that issue.
A new environment will be started and the branch will be named for the issue.

Any code review URL can also be prefixed with gitpod.io/# to start a new environment for that code review.

In the code review mode, the file changes list will be on the left and the changed code can be explored.

For example, the URL for FreeCodeCamp is:

https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp
