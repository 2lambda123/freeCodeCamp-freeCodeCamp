# The Official freeCodeCamp Moderator Onboarding Guide

This guide will help new moderators get up-and-running with the processes and procedures followed by experienced moderators on the fCC community forum and other official communities that we foster.

> If you haven't read [The Moderator Handbook](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/moderator-handbook) yet, you should start there first.

## The Forum

### First Steps

The first thing you may notice after being given moderator status on the forum is that your interface will look somewhat different with new admin tools to explore and access to the Mod-Team subforum as well.

To get familiar with the new tools and powers you can combine one or more of the following methods during your first week with this elevated role.

### Shadow a Mod

All moderator actions can be followed by reviewing the [action logs](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/admin/logs/staff_action_logs). The actions taken by automated tools like 'akistmet' or 'system' can mostly be ignored until they result in a post that needs to be reviewed. Posts to be reviewed will show up in the [Review](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/review) area of the forum.

For the first week or so you will want to pay attention to what is getting flagged and what is being reviewed and compare that to the actions being taken upon the flagged posts. So you may see the system account flag a post because the user created it too quickly. In many cases, the moderators will unflag the post by clicking on the "Approve Post" button or mark it as "Not Spam" (depending on the flag type).

Other actions you may see moderators do is a 'split topic'. Which can be interpreted as either a moderator has split a post that was made in error into the tail-end of a topic that is aleady closed into its own thread for eg or a moderator merging duplicate topics that a single user has created for the same fCC challenge. Watching this procedure will highlight different actions and their causes.

### Become Familiar with the Discourse Admin Tools

### Read Mod-Team Subforum Posts

The Mod-Team subforum contains a number of posts from past and current moderators discussing the different requirements and/or challenges of moderating the forum.

Reading back through these posts can help to uncover some of the underlying goals and processes that concern forum moderators. Some of the threads may also shed some light on handling of spam and inappropriate content on the forum.

## Where to Ask for Help

To get help dealing with a situation that you are either uncomfortable with or unsure of how to handle, discuss with your fellow moderators on either the [Mod-Team Subforum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/mod-team/4) or the [#mod-chat](https://discord.com/channels/692816967895220344/693157007418720277) on Discord.
