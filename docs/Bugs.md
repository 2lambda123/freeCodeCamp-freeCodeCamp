How to Fix Bugs and Contribute to FreeCodeCamp Guidelines for the First Time

This is a guide on how to fix bugs to contribute to FreeCodeCamp.

Getting Started

Read our ["How to Contribute to Open Source Guide"](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source). 
It's a comprehensive reference for first-timer-friendly projects. And it includes a lot of open source contribution tips.

Please first go through [**`help wanted`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) 
or [**`first timers only`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22first+timers+only%22) issues 
for a quick overview of what is available for you to work on.

> [!TIP] **`help wanted`** issues are up for grabs, and you do not need to seek permission before working on them. 
However, issues with the **`first timers only`** label are special issues that are designed for people who have not contributed to the freeCodeCamp codebase before.

Below is the general flow to fix bugs:

Identify the bug

Brainstrom solutions to solve the bug

Implement the solution that fixes the bug

Use the Debugger to find if the fix has any additional bugs.

Once the Bug is Fixed and there are no issues, please issue a pull request in Github.
