### ស្រាវជ្រាវ,  សរសេរ និង​ Update​ guide articles របស់យើង

**តើអ្វីជា guide articles?**

Guide articles ជួយអោយអ្នកយល់អំពីបរិបថនៃបច្ចេកវិទ្យា។ Guide articles ជាអត្ថបទខ្លីសរសេរជាភាសាអង់គ្លេស ដែល​អ្នកគួរគប្បីអានមុននឺងសិក្សាអោយកាន់តែសីុជម្រៅ។

អ្នកអាចរក [ឧទាហរណ៍អត្ថបទ HTML Anchor Elements នៅទីនេះ](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/guide/english/html/elements/a-tag/index.md).

**តើអ្នកអាចសរសេរអត្ថបទអំពីអ្វី?**

យើងស្វាគមន៏អ្នកក្នុងការសរសេរអត្ថបទ។ អ្នកមិនចាំបាច់ទាមទារអោយមានសមត្ថភាពខ្ពស់ក្នុងប្រធានបទដែលអ្នកសរសេរនោះទេ។ អត្ថបទណែនាំទាំងមូលមានទម្រង់ជា open source, ហេតុដូចនេះប្រសិនបើអ្នកមានកំហុសលើចំនុចណាមួយ, contributor​ ផ្សេងទៀតនីងកែតម្រូវវា។

ជាជំនួយ, ស្វែងរក `stub article` នៅក្នុង [Guide website](https://guide.freecodecamp.org), សរសេរជាអត្ថបទ, បន្ទាប់មកធ្វើការបើក pull request ដើម្បីជំនួស stub នៅក្នុងអត្ថបទ។ [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) គឺជាការសូមសំណូមពរធ្វើការផ្លាស់ប្តូរ។ វាអាចឪ្យអ្នកដទៃដឹងអំពីវា, ពិនិត្យ, ហើយទទួលយកការផ្លាស់ប្តូររបស់អ្នក។

ប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនអាចរក stub ដែលទាក់ទងនឹងទៅនឹងអត្ថបទដែលអ្នកសរសេរ, អ្នកអាចធ្វើការ​ Pull Request ដែលបង្កើត stub រួមជាមួយអត្ថបទព្រាង។

ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់កែលម្អអត្ថបទណែនាំ, here's [how to work on guide articles](/docs/how-to-work-on-guide-articles.md).

### Create, Update and Fix Bugs in our coding challenges

All our coding challenges are curated by the community, bringing in expert knowledge from volunteers like you.

You can help expand them and make their wording clearer. You can update the user stories to explain the concept better and even remove redundant ones. You can also improve the challenge tests to make them more accurately test people's code.

If you're interested in improving these coding challenges, here's [how to work on coding challenges](/docs/how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md).

### Translate guide articles and coding challenges

You can help us translate our Guide articles and Coding challenges for a language that you speak. Currently, we have translated versions in:

- [Chinese (中文)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/curriculum/challenges/chinese)
- [Russian (русский)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/curriculum/challenges/russian)
- [Arabic (عربي)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/curriculum/challenges/arabic)
- [Spanish (Español)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/curriculum/challenges/spanish)
- [Portuguese (Português)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/curriculum/challenges/portuguese)

We would love your help in improving the quality of these translations. Millions of people use the English language version of freeCodeCamp.org, and we expect millions more to use these translated versions as well.

### Help us fix bugs in freeCodeCamp.org's learning platform

Our learning platform runs on a modern JavaScript stack. It has various components, tools and libraries, including but not limited to, Node.js, MongoDB, LoopBack, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, Webpack, and more.

Broadly,

- We have a Node.js based API server.
- A set of React based client applications.
- A script that we use to evaluate our front-end projects.

Contributing to this requires some understanding of APIs, ES6 Syntax, and a lot of curiosity.

Essentially, we expect basic familiarity with some of the aforementioned technologies, tools, and libraries. With that being said, you are not required to be an expert on them in order to contribute.

Feel free to ask us questions on the related issue threads, and we will be glad to clarify. When in doubt, you can reach Mrugesh Mohapatra [`@raisedadead`](https://github.com/raisedadead) or Stuart Taylor [`@bouncey`](https://github.com/bouncey) from our platform dev team to help you with this.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How can I report a bug that is not on board?**

If you think you've found a bug, first read the ["Help I've Found a Bug"](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-report-a-bug/19543) article and follow its instructions.

If you're confident it's a new bug, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so that we can reproduce the bug. We have a pre-defined issue template to help you through this.

Please note that any issues that seek coding help on a challenge will be closed. The issue tracker is strictly for codebase related issues and discussions. Whenever in doubt, you should [seek assistance on the forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum) before making a report.

**How can I report a security issue?**

Please don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to `security@freecodecamp.org` and we'll look into it immediately.

**I am stuck on something that is not included in this documentation. How can I get help?**

Feel free to ask for help in:

- [The "Contributors" category of our public forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/c/contributors)
- [Our public contributors chat room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors)

We are excited to help you contribute to any of the topics that you would like to work on. Make sure you search for your query before posting a new one. Be polite and patient. Our community of volunteers and moderators are always around to guide you through your queries.

**I am new to GitHub and Open Source in general:**

Read our [How to Contribute to Open Source Guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source).

**What do these different labels that are tagged on issues mean?**

Our community moderators [triage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Bug_management) issues and pull requests based on their priority, severity, and other factors. You can [find a complete glossary of their meanings here](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/labels).

You should go through [**`help wanted`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [**`first timers welcome`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22first+timers+welcome%22) issues for a quick overview of what is available for you to work on. These are up for grabs, and you do not need to seek permission before working on them.

If these issues lack clarity on what needs to be done, feel free to ask questions in the comments.

**I found a typo, should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?**

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without first creating an issue. Issues are more for discussing larger problems associated with code or structural aspects of the curriculum.
