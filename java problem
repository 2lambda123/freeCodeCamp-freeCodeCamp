Create a program calledDetermineAge that asks for the last two digits of the year in which a Peel student was born (for example,89 for 1989) and the last two digits of the current year (for example, 06 for 2006).  It should then calculate the studentâ€™s age.  The program must also work for those born after the year 2000.
