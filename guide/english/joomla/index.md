# Joomla!

Joomla! (the exclamation mark is an official part of the logo and name) is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) built on a model–view–controller web application framework that can be used independently of the CMS. It is developed by Open Source Matters, Inc.

Joomla! is written in object-oriented programming (OOP) PHP. It can store data in MySQL, PostgreSQL or MS SQL database. Features include page caching, RSS feeds, printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, search, and support for language internationalization.

With a strong and large online community and a vast number of developers who support their products, Joomla! offers the ability for novices and professionals to create websites for any business or professional need. 

Joomla! has an extensive list of independent developers who offer themes, plugins, and extensions to meet the growing needs of the community; and the number of developers continues to increase as Joomla! continuously improves the core system.
