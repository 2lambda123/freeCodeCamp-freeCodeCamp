## Apache Modules

Modules allow Apache to perform additional functions by extending the Apache server. An administrator can easily configure Apache by adding and removing the modules according to required needs. Apache comes with a set or pre-installed modules.

To view a list of installed modules, you can run the command:

```httpd -M```
