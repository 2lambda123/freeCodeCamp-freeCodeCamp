## Comments

Comments allow you to document your code. Comments are ignored by the Swift compiler, and are only useful for people reading your code base.

Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes `//`.

#### Example:
```swift
    // Hello, single-line comment!
```

Multiline comments begin with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk `/*` and ends with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash `*/`

#### Example:
```swift
   /* Hello,
   multiline-line comment! */
```
There are also "special" comments usefull for navigation through code. 

#### Example:
```swift
    //MARK: Separates some logical part of your code

    //TODO: Mark code that needs more work to be done

    //FIXME: Add annotation for a code that needs fixing
```
