# Comments

Comments allow you to document your code. Comments are ignored by the Swift compiler, and are only useful for people reading your code base.

Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes `//`.

**Example:**

```Swift
    // Hello, single-line comment!
```

Multi-line comments begin with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk `/*` and ends with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash `*/`

**Example:**

```Swift
   /* Hello, this is a
   multi-line comment! */
```
