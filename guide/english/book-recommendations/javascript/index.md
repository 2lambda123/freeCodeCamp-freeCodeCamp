#### JavaScript: The Good Parts

Book by the "grandfather" of JavaScript, Douglas Crockford. He discusses both the "good" and "bad" aspects of JavaScript. Note: The 1st edition of this book written in 2008 has never been updated and many of the things the book discusses are now out of date. It is good reading for someone who wants to understand why Crockford was so important to the history of JavaScript, but many of the techniques he recommends in the book are no longer best practice.
