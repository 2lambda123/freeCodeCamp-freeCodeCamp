## Choosing a distribution.

There are various types of Linux distributions to choose from nowadays. Choosing one is a major concern in the Linux world. The Operating Systems (OSs) that are easiest to use are:
Ubuntu - A derivative of the stable Debian system, Ubuntu thrives in the a easy-to-use and up-to-date environment.
Mint - Based on Ubuntu and Debian, this OS has great features, such as Ubuntu's PPA compatibility, and the APT package manager. The base Mint distribution is reminiscent of Windows. This feature can be a nice characteristic for users coming from that operating system. 
Trisquel - A distribution  derived from Ubuntu that focuses on only utilizing fully free software. Trisquel is endorsed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

## Installing.

Most Linux distributions are extremely easy to install. All information is shown at each step of the installation process.

One important step to look out for is at the time of deciding where to install your new Linux distribution ("distro"). For first-time users, it's better to choose the "Guided" option, because it will do all the work for you.

Remember to read all the steps carefully, and leave some space in your HDD for the new distro. About 30Gb, minimum, is desirable.

## The dreaded Terminal.

Linux's terminal is not to be feared. Atually, it is quite easy to use with some practice, and it can make daily tasks highly automated.

In Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives, the shortcut to open the Command Line Interface (CLI) is "Ctrl + Alt + T". Let's open the terminal and try some commands.

cd (Change Directory) - The cd command is one of the commands you will use the most at the command line in Linux. It allows you to change your working directory. You use it to move around within the hierarchy of your file system.

```unix
cd
```

Using the cd command alone will change the current directory to your user home directory, located in "/home/username", as in "/home/mark".

ls (List) - This command lists the content in the current directory. It can be also used to list file information.

```unix
ls
```
Now we can see the files in our home directory.
