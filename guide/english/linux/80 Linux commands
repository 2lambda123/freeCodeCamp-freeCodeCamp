B 
bzip2
A portable, fast, open source program that compresses and decompresses files at a high rate, but that does not archive them.

C 
cat
A Unix/Linux command that can read, modify or concatenate text files. The cat command also displays file contents.

cd
The cd command changes the current directory in Linux and can conveniently toggle between directories. The Linux cd command is similar to the CD and CHDIR commands in MS-DOS.

chmod
The chmod command changes the permissions of one or more files. Only the file owner or a privileged user can change the access mode.

chown
The chown prompt changes file or group ownership. It gives admins the option to change ownership of all the objects within a directory tree, as well as the ability to view information on the objects processed.

cmp
The cmp utility compares two files of any type and writes the results to the standard output. By default, cmp is silent if the files are the same. If they differ, cmp reports the byte and line number where the first difference occurred.

comm

cp
The cp command copies files and directories. Copies can be made simultaneously to another directory even if the copy is under a different name.

cpio
The cpio command copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive. A tar archive is a file that contains other files, plus information about them, such as their file name, owner, timestamps and access permissions. The archive can be another file on the disk, a magnetic tape or a pipe. It also has three operating modes: copy-out, copy-in and copy-pass. It is alsoÂ­ a more efficient alternative to tar.

CRON
CRON is a Linux system process that executes a program at a preset time. To use a CRON script, admins must prepare a text file that describes the program and when they want CRON to execute it. Then, the crontab program loads the text file and executes the program at the specified time.

locate 
The locate command reads one or more databases and writes file names to match certain output patterns.

lft
The lft command determines connection routes and provides information to debug connections or find a box/system location. It also displays route packets and file types.

ln
The ln command creates a new name for a file using hard linking, which allows multiple users to share one file.

ls
The ls command lists files and directories within the current working directory, which allows admins to see when configuration files were last edited.

lsof
Admins use lsof to list all the open files. They can add -u to find the number of open files by username.

lsmod
The lsmod command displays a module's status within the kernel, which helps troubleshoot server function issues.

M 
man
The man command allows admins to format and display the user manual that's built into Linux distributions, which documents commands and other system aspects.

more

nslookup
A user can enter a host name and find the corresponding IP address with nslookup. It can also help find the host name.

O 
od
The od command dumps binary files in octal -- or hex/binary -- format to standard output.

P 
passwd
Admins use passwd to update a user's current password.

ping       
The ping command verifies that a particular IP address exists and can accept requests. It can test connectivity and determine response time, as well as ensure an operating user's host computer is working.

ps
Admins use ps to report the statuses of current processes in a system.

pwd
The print working directory (pwd) command displays the name of the current working directory.

R 
read
The read command interprets lines of text from standard input and assigns values of each field in the input line to shell variables for further processing.

rsync
This command syncs data from one disk or file to another across a network connection. It is similar to rcp, but has more options.

S 
screen
The GNU screen utility is a terminal multiplexor where a user can use a single terminal window to run multiple terminal applications or windows.

sdiff       
Admins use sdiff to compare two files and produce a side-by-side listing indicating lines that are dissimilar. The command then merges the files and outputs the results to the outfile.

sed
The sed utility is a stream editor that filters text in a pipeline, distinguishing it from other editors. It takes text input, performs operations on it and outputs the modified text. This command is typically used to extract part of a file using pattern matching or to substitute multiple occurrences of a string within a file.

T 
tar
The tar command lets users create archives from a number of specified files or to extract files from a specific archive.

tail        

The tail command displays the last few lines of the file. This is particularly helpful for troubleshooting code because admins don't often need all the possible logs to determine code errors.

TOP
TOP is a set of protocols for networks that performs distributed information processing and displays the tasks on the system that take up the most memory. TOP can sort tasks by CPU usage, memory usage and runtime.

touch
Admins can create a blank file within Linux with the touch command.

tr
This command translates or deletes characters from a text stream. It writes to a standard output, but it does not accept file names as arguments -- it only accepts input from standard input.

traceroute
The traceroute function determines and records a route through the internet between two computers and is useful for troubleshooting network/router issues. If the domain does not work or is not available, admins can use traceroute to track the IP.

U
