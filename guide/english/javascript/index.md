## JavaScript
JavaScript is the most widely used scripting language on Earth. And it has the largest library ecosystem of any programming language.

JavaScript is the core language of the web, and the only programming language that can run in all major web browsers. It is used to add more creative and entertaining content to the site by introducting animation and visul effects. It helps your website look more lively.

Notably, JavaScript has no relation to Java. [JavaScript: The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/javascript.html)

The official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript defined under Standard [ECMA-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)

If you want to learn more about the JavaScript language, and why it's so widely used, read Quincy Larson's article - [Which programming language should I learn first?](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-programming-language-should-i-learn-first-%CA%87d%C4%B1%C9%B9%C9%94s%C9%90%CA%8C%C9%90%C9%BE-%C9%B9%C7%9D%CA%8Dsu%C9%90-19a33b0a467d) -

## Standalone JavaScript engines
-Mozilla's SpiderMonkey, the first JavaScript engine ever written, currently used in Mozilla Firefox.
V8, Google's JavaScript engine, used in Google Chrome.

-Google Apps Script, a cloud-based/server-side interpreter that provides programmatic "macro-like" control of Google Apps services and - documents.

-Node.js, built on top of V8, a platform which enables server-side applications to be written in JavaScript.

-Windows includes JScript, a JavaScript variant in Windows Script Host.

-Chakra, a fork of Jscript, is developed by Microsoft and used in their Edge browser.

-Mozilla also offers Rhino, an implementation of JavaScript built in Java, typically embedded into Java applications to provide        scripting to end users.

-WebKit (except for the Chromium project) implements the JavaScriptCore engine.

-JSDB - A standalone JavaScript shell, with compiled binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

-JavaLikeScript - A standalone, extensible JavaScript shell including both native and JavaScript libraries.

-GLUEscript - A standalone JavaScript shell for writing cross-platform JavaScript applications.  It can use wxWidgets for GUI apps and was formerly called wxJavaScript.

-jspl - A standalone JavaScript shell enhanced by Perl. Can use Perl modules directly from JavaScript: DBI for database integration, GTK2 for GUI apps, POSIX for system programming, etc. The best of CPAN now for JavaScript programmers.

-ShellJS - Portable Unix shell commands for Node.js
