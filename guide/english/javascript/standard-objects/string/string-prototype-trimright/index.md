## String.prototype.trimright

The `righttrim()` function removes any whitespace characters from the end (the right side) of a given string. It returns a new string. It does not modify the original string.

Examples:
```js
"  This string has two spaces at the beginning and a tab and two spaces at the end.	  ".trim();
// output: "  This string has two spaces at the beginning and a tab and two spaces at the end."
```

`righttrim()` removes any whitespace character, not just spaces or tabs.
