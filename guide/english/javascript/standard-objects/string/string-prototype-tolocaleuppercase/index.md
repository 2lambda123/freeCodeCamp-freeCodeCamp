## String.prototype.toLocaleUpperCase

The `toLocaleUpperCase()` function converts a string's content to upper case letters based on the language settings of the host's browser. This method is often the same as `toUpperCase()`, however for some locales, such as Turkish, the results can vary.

For examples see the MDN link in the More Information section.
