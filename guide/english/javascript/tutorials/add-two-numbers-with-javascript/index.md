title: Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
---
JavaScript uses the `+` symbol for addition. It can also be used instead of `parseInt()` but that is beyond this.

```javascript
var sum = 10 + 10;
```
    
Variables can be added in a similar fashion.

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 10;
let z = x + y;
console.log(z);    // Will print 20 to the console
```
