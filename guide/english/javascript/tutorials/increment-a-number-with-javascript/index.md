title: Increment a Number with JavaScript

You can easily increment or add `1` to a variable with the `++` operator.

    i++;

is the equivalent of

    i = i + 1;

**Note** The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

It is also possible to add more than `1` to a variable.
You can do this with the `+=` operator

    i+=4;
    
is the equivalent of

    i = i + 4;
