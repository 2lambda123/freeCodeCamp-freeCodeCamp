title: Decrement a Number with JavaScript
---
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by `1` with the `--` operator.

    i--;

is the equivalent of

    i = i - 1;

**Note:** The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

It is also possible to decrease the variable with more than `1`.
You can do this with the `-=` operator
     i-=4;
    
is the equivalent of
     i = i - 4;
