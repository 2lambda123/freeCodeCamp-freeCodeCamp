## What is Julia?

<a href='https://julialang.org' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Julia</a> is a 
high-performance, optionally-typed programming language aimed for scientific and numerical computing. It features libraries for linear algebra, numeric optimization, signal processing and machine learning among others. It uses multiple dispatch and has an LLVM backend and JIT compiler.
Julia is selected to be used in the development of the safety critic <a href='https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/lincoln-labs.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>next generation airborne collision avoidance system.</a> 

 Julia is a new programming language, still in beta, which uses concepts from several well established programming languages in order to create an easy-to-use high performance software. As such, Julia has several key aims to achieve. Firstly, the speed of compiled languages (C/C++, Fortran) is desired. Furthermore, Julia aims at the dynamism of high-level languages, such as Ruby or Python, and the mathematical notations of MatLAB. Lastly, the general usage of Python, and the statistical ease of R are wanted.
