## What is Julia?

<a href='https://julialang.org' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Julia</a> is a 
high-performance, optionally-typed programming language aimed for scientific and numerical computing. It features libraries for linear algebra, numeric optimization, signal processing and machine learning among others. It uses multiple dispatch and has an LLVM backend and JIT compiler.
Julia is selected to be used in the development of the safety critic <a href='https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/lincoln-labs.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>next generation airborne collision avoidance system.</a> 

## A Summary of Features in Julia

Some of the important features to highlight from data science capabilities are:

Good performance, approaching that of statically-compiled languages like C
Built-in package manager to make life easier
Lisp-like macros and other metaprogramming facilities
Call C functions directly & Python functions: use the PyCall package
Powerful shell-like capabilities for managing other processes
Designed for parallelism and distributed computation
User-defined types are as fast and compact as built-ins
Automatic generation of efficient, specialized code for different argument types
Elegant and extensible conversions and promotions for numeric and other types
