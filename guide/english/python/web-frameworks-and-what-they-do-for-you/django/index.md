## Overview:

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

Ridiculously fast.
Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.

Fully loaded.
Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common Web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box.

Reassuringly secure.
Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.

Exceedingly scalable.
Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands.

Incredibly versatile.
Companies, organizations and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things — from content management systems to social networks to scientific computing platforms.

### Get started with Django:

A full guide on different ways to install Django can be found on the official website of the [Django Foundation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/install/). Installing Django is not hard, the process is outlined below.
 
As Django is a Python Web framework, you first need to make sure you have the correct version of Python installed or update to the [latest version](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
 
Python comes with the SQLite database so you don’t have to set one up, but you can decide to use another database.

Once you have made sure you have the right version of Python, installing an official release of Django with pip is the easiest option, but there are other ways, as indicated in the [Django installation guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/install/). 

It is recommended that you first set up a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments), this will help to keep your coding environment tidy as it isolates your Django and Python setup per project.

After creating and running your virtual environment, write `pip install Django` in your command line.

When you are done with the installation you can follow the official ['Writing your first Django app' tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/).

The Django Girls Foundation also has a detailed [tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) (including installation) on building a blog with Django.
