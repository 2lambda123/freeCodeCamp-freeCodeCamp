title: The Python Data Structures
---
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Python comes with a robust set of inbuilt data structures. Some of the most commonly used ones are :-  
* Lists  
* Tuples  
* Dictionaries  

Majorly, the data structures can be divided into two categories :-  
* Mutable :- A mutable data structure is a structure whose state can  be modified after it is created. Python Lists and Dictionaries are mutable.  
* Immutable :- An immutable data structure can't be modified. Example :- Once a tuple is created, we can't update the values inside it.

#Additional
The above mentioned  data structure are in build one which have their own advantages and limitations. such as each operation operated on them such as find,replace,append have their own time complexity, but to use them we just have to invoke them and they ready to use . but for using data structure in larger complex computational problems people prefer to use their own structure which allows them to  modify complexity accourding to their needs and are easy to use . some examples may be:
* Trees (Binary)
* graphs
* ordered and unordered list .... and many more
