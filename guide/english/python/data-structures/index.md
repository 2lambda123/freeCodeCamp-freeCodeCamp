title: The Python Data Structures
---
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Python comes with a robust set of inbuilt data structures. Some of the most commonly used ones are :-  
* Lists  
* Tuples  
* Dictionaries  

Majorly, the data structures can be divided into two categories :-  
* Mutable :- A mutable data structure is a structure whose state can  be modified after it is created. Python Lists and Dictionaries are mutable.  
* Immutable :- An immutable data structure can't be modified. Example :- Once a tuple is created, we can't update the values inside it.
