## Zip Files and Folder

ZIP file format

ZIP is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression. A ZIP file may contain one or more files or directories that may have been compressed.
Python allows you to quickly create zip/tar archives.

A good way to zip in python is to use the following command wich zip the whole directory `dir_name`
```shutil.make_archive(output_filename, 'zip', dir_name)```

Why? Because the module shutil is part of the python standard library, so you don't need to install anything to make it work.

Here are the steps to create Zip File in Python:
####Step1 
To create an archive file from Python, make sure you have your import statement correct and in order. Here the import statement for the archive is 
`from shutil import make_archive`

####Step 2
<li>Import make_archive class from module shutil</li>
<li>Then we call the module `shutil.make_archive(output_filename, "zip", root_dir)` to create archive file, which will be in zip format</li>
<li>When you run the code, you can see the archive zip file is created in the working directory</li>
