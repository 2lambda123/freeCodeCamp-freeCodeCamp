Python objects can contain methods, which are functions embedded inside of an object. These functions can only be used called by it from the object.

```python
class Person:
  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello, World!")

person1 = Person()
person1.myfunc()
```

There are also special methods called constructors, whch have a double underline before and after the name of the method. The following are examples of constructors:

*__init__ This method is called when an object is created from the class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of a class.
*__rpr__  This method is used to define the "official" string representation of an object.
