FAST, RELIABLE, AND SECURE DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT.
   
Ultra Fast.
Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to download it again. It also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever

Mega Secure.
Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.

Super Reliable.
Using a detailed, but concise, lockfile format, and a deterministic algorithm for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that an install that worked on one system will work exactly the same way on any other system.

Offline Mode
If you've installed a package before, you can install it again without any internet connection.

Deterministic
The same dependencies will be installed the same exact way across every machine regardless of install order.

Network Performance
Yarn efficiently queues up requests and avoids request waterfalls in order to maximize network utilization.

Same Packages
Install any package from npm and keep your package workflow the same.

Network Resilience
A single request failing won't cause an install to fail. Requests are retried upon failure.

Flat Mode
Resolve mismatching versions of dependencies to a single version to avoid creating duplicates.
