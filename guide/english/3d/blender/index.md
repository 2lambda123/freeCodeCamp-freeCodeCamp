## Blender

Blender is a free and open source 3D creation suite. It's used for modeling, creating photorealistic renders, simulation, model sculpting, architecture models, compositing, character design, animation, rigging, level design, 2D rendered scenes, motion graphics, game development, VFX, video editing and much more!

Since Blender is cross-platform, it can run on Windows, Linux and macOS. Blender is supported by The Blender Foundation, a public-benefit organization from the Netherlands. Developers, animators, scientists, experts and even hobbyists empower the software's development by constantly maintaining, fixing and making new features for a suitable and more responsive user experience.

Blender was released under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**.
