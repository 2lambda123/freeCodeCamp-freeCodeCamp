## Databases


#### More Information:
Now a days we daily come across phrases such as "Data is the new fuel" etc.So anything which we see on internet is one or different kind of data.You can't imagine the vastness of internet and hence the vastness of data.**Database** is an **organized** collection of data, stored and accessed electronically.

Database designers typically organize the data to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as (for example) modeling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies. 

**Database management system**

Software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database.

External interaction with the database will be via an application program that interfaces with the DBMS.This can range from a database tool that allows users to execute SQL queries textually or graphically, to a web site that happens to use a database to store and search information.
