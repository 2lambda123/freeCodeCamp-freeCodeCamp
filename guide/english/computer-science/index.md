# Computer Science

Computer Science is the study of computers and the concepts that make computers possible. It is a scientific approach to computation and its applications. This includes the study of the structure, expression, and algorithms that underlie the manipulation of data.

Much of computer science was pioneered in the latter half of the 20th century.

Today, if you attend an undergraduate computer science course, you will learn about both hardware and software. You'll learn how computers work at a low level of abstraction (machine language) and at a high level of abstraction (modern scripting langauges like JavaScript).

In 21st century, computer science has become a backbone for every technological leap we take forward.

# Computer Science Fields
Computer science is categorized into several fields. The following are among the current established and well-studied fields. Most of the fields are further categorized into subfields.

David J. Malan (/meɪlɛn/) is Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of Computer Science at Harvard University.[1][2] Malan is best known for teaching Computer Science 50 (known as CS50)[3][4][5][6] which is the largest course at both Harvard and Yale University and the largest Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) at edX with lectures being viewed by over a million people on the edX platform up to 2017.[7][8]

Malan is a member of faculty in the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences where his research interests include cybersecurity,[9][10] digital forensics, botnets,[11] computer science education, distance learning, collaborative learning, and computer-assisted instruction.[12][13] Malan is also an active member of the SIGCSE community,[14][4][15] a Special Interest Group (SIG) concerned with Computer Science Education (CSE) organised by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
