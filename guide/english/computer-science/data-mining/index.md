# Data Mining 

A subfield of Computor Science where the main goal is to extract patterns and information (using intelligent methods) from a larger data set and transform the information collected into a simpler, more useable form, for later use.



## Process: knowledge discovery in databases(KKD)

Data Mining is the **analysis**, or **4th step** of KKD.

| Steps          | KDD  |
| ------------- | :-----|
| 1   Selection  |Identifying the source information. |
| 2  Pre processing |Picking the data points that need to be analyzed.|
| 3  Transformation| Extracting the relevant information from the data. |
| 4  Data mining |Identifying the key values from the extracted data set.|
| 5 Evaluation| Interpreting and reporting the results. |

There are many variations of this, such as the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP_DM) which has six phases.

| Phase          | CRISP-DM  |
| ------------- | :-----|
| 1     |Business understanding |
| 2   |Data understanding|
| 3  | Data preperation |
| 4  |Modeling|
| 5 |Deployment|

## The Task of Data Mining
The analysis of large quantities of data, to extract previously unknown information, in the form of interesting patterns. 

|  Groups of Patterns        | Analysis Type  |
| ------------- | :-----|
| Data Records     |Cluster Analysis |
| Unusual Records  |Anomaly Detection|
| Dependencies | Association Rule Mining, Sequencial Pattern Mining |
| Generalization of known structures   |Classification |
| Estimation of Relationships among data/datasets  |Regression|
| Compact Records of the data set | Summarization |

These examples usually involve using specific database techniques. The data patterns collected are seen as a summary of the input data.

**Data collection, data preperation or the end result of reporting, is not part of the actual Data Mining.**


## Related Terms of Data Mining

**data dredging**, **data fishing** and **data snooping** are all methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are too small for reliable statistical forcasting to be applied to the patterns discovered from the data sets. 

The same methods can be used though, for crreating hypotheses to test against larger populations.


## Standards
Efforts to provide standards for the data mining process have happened over time.

| Standard       | Year Inacted  |
| ------------- | :-----|
|  Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM 1.0)   |1999 European |
|  Java Data Mining standard (JDM 1.0).  |2004|

Further development of these standards have produced (CRISP-DM 2.0 and JDM 2.0), these are not currently being developed any further.

## Exchanging Extracted Models, Standard

| Language      |Standard |
| ------------- | :-----|
|  Predictive Model Markup (PMML)   | Predictive Analytics |

This is an XML-based language developed by the Data Mining Group(DMG)and is supported as an exchange format by many data mining applications. It is only used for Predictive Analytics, a data mining task of high importance to business applications.

## Computor Science Conferences on Data Mining


[CIKM Conference – ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management](http://www.cikmconference.org/)  
Circa 1992. Research conference dedicated to information management(IM) and knowledge management(KM).

[SIGIR onference - Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval](http://sigir.org/)The annual international SIGIR conference, which began in 1978, is considered the most important in the field of information retrieval.

[ECML PKDD - European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases](http://ecmlpkdd2019.org/)  
The leading academic conference on Machine Learning(ML). Held in Europe every year.

[KDD Conference – ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining](https://www.kdd.org/)  
Association for Computing Machinery's(ACM) Special Interest Group(SIG) on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. (It became an official SIG in 1998.)
