# Data Mining 

A subfield of Computor Science where the main goal is to extract patterns and information (using intelligent methodolgy) from a larger data set and transform the information collected into a simpler, more useable form, for later use.



## Process: knowledge discovery in databases(KKD)

Data Mining is the **analysis**, or **4th step** of KKD.

| Steps          | KDD  |
| ------------- | :-----|
| 1   Selection  |Identifying the source information. |
| 2  Pre processing |Picking the data points that need to be analyzed.|
| 3  Transformation| Extracting the relevant information from the data. |
| 4  Data mining |Identifying the key values from the extracted data set.|
| 5 Evaluation| Interpreting and reporting the results. |

There are many variations of this, such as the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP_DM) which has six phases.

| Phase          | CRISP-DM  |
| ------------- | :-----|
| 1     |Business understanding |
| 2   |Data understanding|
| 3  | Data preperation |
| 4  |Modeling|
| 5 |Deployment|

## The Task of Data Mining
Occuring semi-automatically or automatically, is the analysis of large quantities of data, to extract previously unknown information, in the form of interesting patterns. 

|  Groups of Patterns        | Analysis Type  |
| ------------- | :-----|
| Data Records     |Cluster Analysis |
| Unusual Records  |Anomaly Detection|
| Dependencies | Association Rule Mining, Sequencial Pattern Mining |
| Generalization of known structures   |Classification |
| Estimation of Relationships among data/datasets  |Regression|
| Compact Records of the data set | Summarization |

These examples usually involve using specific database techniques. The data patterns collected are seen as a summary of the input data.

**Data collection, data preperation or the end result of reporting, is not part of the actual Data Mining.**


## Related Terms of Data Mining

data dredging, data fishing and data snooping are all methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are too small for reliable statistical forcasting to be applied to the patterns discovered from the data sets. 

The same methods can be used though, for crreating hypotheses to test against larger populations.


## Standards
Efforts to define standards for the data mining process.

| Standard       | Year Inacted  |
| ------------- | :-----|
|  Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM 1.0)   |1999 European |
|  Java Data Mining standard (JDM 1.0).  |2004|

Further development of these standards have produced (CRISP-DM 2.0 and JDM 2.0), these are not currently being developed further.

## Exchanging Extracted Models, Standard

| Language      |Standard |
| ------------- | :-----|
|  Predictive Model Markup (PMML)   | Predictive Analytics |

This is an XML-based language developed by the Data Mining Group(DMG)and is supported as an exchange format by many data mining applications. It is obly used for Predictive Analytics, a data mining task of high importance to business applications.
