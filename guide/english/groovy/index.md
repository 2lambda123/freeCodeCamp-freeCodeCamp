## Groovy
Apache Groovy or Groovy is a powerful and dynamic language with static compilation and typing capabilities for the Java platform and was designed to increase productivity with its concise and familiar syntax. It integrates with any Java program with ease.

## Differences with Java
Although Groovy tries to be as natural as possible for Java developers, there are some differences. To mitigate this they have attempted to follow the [principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) when designing Groovy, particularly for developers learning Groovy whoâ€™ve come from a Java background. The documentation provides a list which highlights all of the differences between Java and Groovy [here](http://groovy-lang.org/differences.html).
