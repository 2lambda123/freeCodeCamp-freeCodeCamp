The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics which sets the reader in a dilemma
and explores the different justifications of different decisions by individuals.
The problem is this:
You are in a trolley in which the brakes do not work and ahead of you, you see five people tied up to the tracks.
You know that if you keep going, you will kill those people but then you see a side track on which you can steer onto,
however, there is one man tied onto those tracks. Do you steer onto the side track?

Now obviously, most people would say yes since you are saving five lives for the price of one. This is the idea of Utilitarianism
since the goods outweight the bads.

There are different forms of this problem, such as, what if instead of being on the trolley you are an onlooker from a bridge.
Then you can't stop steer the trolley but you see a very fat man leaning over the bridge looking over at the tracks.
You know that if you push the man over, he will crash into the trolley and save those five people tied to the tracks.
Would you push the man?

Most people in this case say no, but how is it different? You are still saving five lives for the price of one.
