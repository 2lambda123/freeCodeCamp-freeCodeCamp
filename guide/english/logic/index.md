## Logic

Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas:

Theoretical foundations and analysis
Use of computer technology to aid logicians
Use of concepts from logic for computer applications

How to solve a programming problem?
Calculate brute force complexity, and then the required complexity. then minimise the complexity by derivating over bruteforce.
if a problem is n^3, and there exist linear relation between the execution , then using this the same can be reduced to n2 or n

In this section, we'll have guides to a wide variety of logical puzzles that are important to math and programming.
