Satisfiability refers to the existence of a combination of values to make the expression true. So in short, a proposition is satisfiable if there is at least one true result in its truth table, valid if all values it returns in the truth table are true.

A formula P is considered satisfiable if it is sometimes true for some assignment of true/false to the variables.

Example:
  - x ^ y : is Satisfiable with x = T, y = T
  - x v y : is Satisfiable with x = T, y = F or x = F, y = T
  
If there are no assignments, then it is considered Unsatisfiable.
