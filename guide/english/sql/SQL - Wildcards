SQL Wildcard Characters
A wildcard character is used to substitute any other character(s) in a string.

Wildcard characters are used with the SQL LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. 

There are two wildcards used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

% - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
_ - The underscore represents a single character

    LIKE Operator	                          Description
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	    Finds any values that starts with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	    Finds any values that ends with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	  Finds any values that have "or" in any position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	    Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%_%'	  Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	    Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"

Example

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'ber%'; -- search for city starting with ber

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '%es%'; -- City containing the pattern "es"

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%'; --selects all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p"

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%'; --selects all customers with a City starting with "a", "b", or "c"

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%'; --select all customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p"

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%'; --select all customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p"
