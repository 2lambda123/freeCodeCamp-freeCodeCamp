## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the most common tool used to manipulate and manage data in a relational database (often referred to as a "SQL database"). SQL is commonly pronounced "sequel." 

The most popular variants are 

* MySQL -  intended for ritical, heavy-load production systems as well as for embedding into mass-deployed software.
* PostgreSQL - most advanced, SQL-compliant and open-source objective-relational database management system.
* SQLite - Unlike most other SQL databases, it reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files and does not use a server process.

SQLite is a version of SQL which is commonly used for prototyping. It introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command, using SQL Queries.
