## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the most common tool used to manipulate and manage data in a relational database (often referred to as a "SQL database").

SQL is commonly pronounced "sequel." Its most popular variants are MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite - a version of SQL which is commonly used for prototyping. It introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command, using SQL Queries.

These SQL Queries, which are often times referred to as "SQL Statements", are used to read, write, delete, and update data from tables in the database. 

SQL is a popular part of PHP and other web programming languages.
