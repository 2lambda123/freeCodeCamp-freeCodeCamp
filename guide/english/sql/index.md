## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the most common tool used to manipulate and manage data in a relational database (often referred to as a "SQL database").

SQL is commonly pronounced "sequel." Its most popular variants are MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite - a version of SQL which is commonly used for prototyping. It introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command, using SQL Queries.

SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.
