The field of **software engineering** is the application of techniques and strategies used to efficiently manage the entire life cycle of software development.  It involves solving real world problems and approaching the solution through computer programs.

If you are writing just scripts that might be used once or twice, implementing software engineering principles may be too involved. However, as software projects get larger and foresee future ongoing use, principles of software engineering become increasingly important.

The entire life cycle of software development ranges from the creation of ideas and design of the software to maintenance of the developed software over time.

You might think of software engineering as just how do you code up something and keep it going. However, an important aspect of software engineering you might not think about is the ethical practice of software development.

In this age where software can be used maliciously to steal information or do harm if software is implemented incorrectly, software engineers (or practitioners) must be aware of their duties to ethically develop software. 

## Subdisciplines

* *Software requirements* : The elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of requirements for software.
* *Software design*: The process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component. It is also defined as the result of that process.
* *Software construction*: The detailed creation of working, meaningful software through a combination of programming (aka coding), verification, unit testing, integration testing, and debugging.
* *Software testing*: An empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test.
* *Software maintenance*: The totality of activities required to provide cost-effective support to software.
* *Software configuration management*: The identification of the configuration of a system at distinct points in time for the purpose of systematically controlling changes to the configuration, and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration throughout the system life cycle. Modern processes use software versioning.
* *Software engineering management*: The application of management activities—planning, coordinating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting—to ensure that the development and maintenance of software is systematic, disciplined, and quantified.
* *Software development process*: The definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of the software life cycle process itself.
* Software engineering models and methods impose structure on software engineering with the goal of making that activity systematic, repeatable, and ultimately more success-oriented
* *Software quality*
* Software engineering professional practice is concerned with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that software engineers must possess to practice software engineering in a professional, responsible, and ethical manner
* Software engineering economics is about making decisions related to software engineering in a business context
* *Computing foundations*
* *Mathematical foundations*
* *Engineering foundations*
