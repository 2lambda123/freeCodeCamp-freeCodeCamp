## Linear Equations

A linear equation is a straight line from one point to another, which can be expressed through an equation or a graph.

The equation for a linear function is **y = mx + b**.

* _'y'_ is the y-coordinates on the slope
* _'mx'_ is the slope, or rate of which the equation is headed. This can be calculated using **(y2-y1/x2-x1)**, where the numerator is the vertical shift, while the denominator is the horizontal shift.
* _'b'_ is the y-intercept, or where the linear function meets the y-axis.

###Typical Linear Line Equation

LP Equations are used to determine the correct coordinates of a constraint line on a LP Graph.
LP Equations will consist of one or more Axiz Variables, a multiplier, an operator if more than one variable is used,
a equality indicator and a Right Hand Side value.

Example:

1. X1 + 2*X2 <= 40

This will result in the line coordinates being (40;20) and limiting the feasible area to the underside of the line.
