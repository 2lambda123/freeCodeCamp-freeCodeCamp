## Algebra  

Algebra is a broad section of mathematics focused on manipulating constants and variables in equations, 
in which letters representing numbers are combined according to the rules of arithmetic. 
The main branches of algebra are listed below.
Elementary algebra: an introduction to these ideas. Covers the solution of polynomial equations in one or more variables and basic properties of functions and graphs.
Abstract algebra: the study of algebraic structures on themselves. 
Linear algebra: the study of vector spaces and linear mappings.

#### Shorty History of Algebra

Algebra isn't a new science part. It is known that algebra improved in India and China thousand years ago. But there is an exact conclusion: Algebra has been used exactly in BCE 1700. At that histories, Egyptians were using the geometry for creating tools. In middle age, there is no considerable improvement in Algebra. But nowadays, we are using the Algebra for a lot of condition even in software development.
