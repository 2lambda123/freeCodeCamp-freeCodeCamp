#### Definition
Suppose V is vector Space over a field F.We Say that a subset S of V is a basis for V if S spans V (i.e every vector in V can be 
written as linear combinations of vectors of S) and the vectors of S are linearly independent.

#### Example
Consider V = R (set of real numbers). Than V is Vector Space.Consider S = {(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)} than S spans V and every element of S is linearly independent .So S is a Basis for V.
