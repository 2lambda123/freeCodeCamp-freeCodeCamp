## Subtracting Fractions with Unlike Denominators
In terms of subtracting fractions, there will be cases where we will have to subtract at least 2 fractions with unlike denominators. There is a certain method that can be used, which is shown in the first example:

## Example 1
![Example 1 Question](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B7%7D%7B5%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D)

In the first example, there are 2 fractions where they have the denominators of 5 and 3 respectively. 

### Step 1
Our first step is to make the denominators equal. This can be done by multiplying the value of the first denominator "5" into the numerator and denominator of 2/3, as well as the second denominator "3" into the numerator and denominator of 7/5, shown here:

![Example 1 Step 1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B7%5Ctimes3%7D%7B5%5Ctimes3%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B2%5Ctimes5%7D%7B3%5Ctimes5%7D)

### Step 2
Afterwards, perform the calculations on these fractions, and simplify these fractions if possible, shown here:

## Example 2
![Example 2 Question](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?4%5Cfrac%7B6%7D%7B7%7D%20-%205%5Cfrac%7B11%7D%7B13%7D)

In some cases, it is possible to receive a question where we have to minus **mixed fractions** with unlike denominators.

### Step 1 
Our first step is to transform these mixed fractions into improper fractions through multiplying the whole number with the denominator, and then adding that answer into the numerator, where the numerator will be simplified:

![Example 2 Step 1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?4%5Cfrac%7B6%7D%7B7%7D%20-%205%5Cfrac%7B11%7D%7B13%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%284%5Ctimes7%29%20&plus;%206%7D%7B7%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B%285%5Ctimes13%29%20&plus;%2011%7D%7B13%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B34%7D%7B7%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B76%7D%7B13%7D)

### Step 2
Afterwards, we will make these denominators equal. This can be achieved through multiplying the value of the first denominator "57" into the numerator and denominator of 76/13, as well as the second denominator "13" into the numerator and denominator of 34/7, shown here:

![Example 2 Step 2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B34%7D%7B7%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B76%7D%7B13%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B34%5Ctimes%2013%7D%7B7%5Ctimes%2013%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B76%5Ctimes%207%7D%7B13%5Ctimes%207%7D)

### Step 3
Lastly, we will perform the calcuations on these fractions, and simplify these fractions if possible, shown here:

![Example 2 Step 3](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B34%5Ctimes%2013%7D%7B7%5Ctimes%2013%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B76%5Ctimes%207%7D%7B13%5Ctimes%207%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B442%7D%7B91%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B532%7D%7B91%7D%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7B90%7D%7B91%7D)
