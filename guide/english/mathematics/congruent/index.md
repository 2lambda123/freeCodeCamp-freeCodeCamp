## Congruent

Congruency is an idea that means, regardless of their location or position or direction, two or more geometric figures have the same shape and size. When two or more things have congruency, they are called congruent.

Operations that result in congruent figures include:
- Rotate
- Reflect
- Translate

Operations that result in congruent figures DO NOT include:
- Dilation

Congruence in triangles can be tested through several theorems, including:

- Side-angle-side: If two of the sides are of equal measure, and one angle is equal in measure, then the triangles are congruent.
- Side-side-side: If all three of the sides of each triangle are of equal measure, then the triangles are congruent.
- Angle-side-angle: If two of the angles of each triangle are of equal measure, and the included sides are equal in measure, then the triangles are congruent.

Interestingly, dilating a shape by a certain scale figure will not produce congruent shapes. But the shapes will be similar and preserve side/angle ratios.
