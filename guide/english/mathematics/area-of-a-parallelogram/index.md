## Area of a Parallelogram

A parallelogram is a four-sided figure in which the opposite sides and angles are equal. It can be considered as being made up of two same  triangles sticked base to base.

The area of a triangle is `1/2 * base * height` and the area of a parallelogram is the addition of areas of the two same triangles.

### Example
Consider a paralleogram as shown in the figure.

Therefore, Area = 6 * 2.5 = 15 (m)^2

## Properties of a Parallelogram

1. Opposite sides are congruent (AB = DC).
2. Opposite angels are congruent (D = B).
3. Consecutive angles are supplementary (A + D = 180Â°).
4. If one angle is right, then all angles are right.
5. The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
6. Each diagonal of a parallelogram separates it into two congruent triangles.
