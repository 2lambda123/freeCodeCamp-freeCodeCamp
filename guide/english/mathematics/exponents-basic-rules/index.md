## Exponents Basic Rules

Exponents are simply how many times a base number is multiplying by itself.

For example,

2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2

So, there are basic properties of exponents that occur when we mathematically manipulate them.

For example,

let's take some real number, x and raise to a power of 1.

x^1 = x

if we raise x to the 0 power, we have 1.

x^0 = 1.

This is because when we reduce the power of a number, we are effectively dividing x^n by x to get to x^(n-1).

Hence, with the same logic we can find x^-n, which is 

x^-n = 1/x^n.
