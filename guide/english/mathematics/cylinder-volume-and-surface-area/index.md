## Cylinder Volume and Surface Area

### Volume - V = πr^2h
### Surface area - 2(πr^2) + 2πrh

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = bwh. Rather than viewing all three of the base, width, and height variables equally, it can be helpful to view this forumla as V = (bw)h - that is - the volume of a rectangular prism is equal to the area of the base multiplied by its height. The volume of a cylinder follows this pattern as well. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2 * h - that is, the area of its base (a circle) multiplied by its height.

The surface area of a cylinder can be thought of as the sums of the surface areas of two circles and a rectangle. The top and bottom faces of the cylinder comprise the 2(πr^2) portion of the formula, and the rectangle comprises the 2πrh portion. Think of round surface of the cylinder as a rectangle wrapped around the two circles. The height of the rectangle is the height of the cylinder h, and the length of the rectangle is the circumference of the base circle. Therefore, the area of the round surface of the cylinder is the product of the circumference of the base circle, 2πr, and the height of the cylinder, h. Adding all these together gets us the formula for the surface area of a cylinder, 2(πr^2) + 2πrh.
