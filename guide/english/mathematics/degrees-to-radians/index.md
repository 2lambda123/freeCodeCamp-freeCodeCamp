## Degrees to Radians

Multiply the angle by pi/180. Remember that pi radians span half of a circle, which is 180 degrees.

Here's a python function to convert degrees to radians. Enjoy!

import math </br>
def degrees_to_radians(angle): </br>
 &nbsp;  return angle*math.pi/180;
	 
#### More Information:
One complete cycle = 360 degrees = 2π Radians

1 degree = 2π / 360 Radians

p degree = p ×  2π / 360 Radians
