## Basic Number Properties Associative, Commutative, and Distributive
These are 3 basic properties of numbers.
<br/><br/>
These properties play an important role in advanced mathematics. Textbooks generally don't discuss them in detail because all
number systems we use up to high school follow these properties by default.
<br/><br/>

## Associativity
  "To associate" means to form groups of operands.
  <br/>
  If an operation (e.g. +, -, &times;, /) is associative it means, <strong>the result will remain same regardless of grouping of operands.</strong>
  <pre>
EXAMPLE
    let a = 3, b = 4, c = 5
      (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
    ->(3 + 4) + 5 = 3 + (4 + 5)
    ->          12=12
  </pre>
  ##### Try it with the multiplication operation and the same variable values as above
  ### Note:
  + Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication are Associative, while Division is not (e.g. 10 / (4 / 2) != (10 / 4) / 2).

<hr/>

## Commutativity
  "To commute" means to move around, in this case, operands move around operator.
  <br/>
  If an operation(e.g. +, -, &times;, /) is commutative it means, <strong>the result will remain same regardless of the order in which the operands are evaluated.</strong>
  <pre>
EXAMPLE
    let a = 3, b = 4
      a + b = b + a
    ->3 + 4 = 4 + 3
    ->    7 = 7
  </pre>
   ##### Try it with the multiplication operation and the same variable values as above
  ### Note:
  + Addition and Multiplication are Commutative, while Subtraction and Division are not (e.g. 22 / 11 != 11 / 22)
  + Subtraction could be considered Commutative but only if it's performed as the addition of negative numbers (12 - 7 != 7 - 12, but 12 + (-7) = (-7) + 12)
  
  <hr/>
  
## Distributivity
  This property can be remembered with the phrase "Multiplication is distributive over addition". <br/><br/> When you are multiplying terms inside a parenthesis by a term outside the parenthesis, it makes no difference whether you first evaluate the contents of the parenthesis then multiply by the external term, or you multiply each separate inner term by the outer term and then evaluate:
  <br/><br/>
  a &times; (b + c) = a &times; b + a &times; c
  <br/><br/>i.e. Multiplication can be performed separately on the operands before addition is performed.
  <br/>
  <pre>
EXAMPLE
  3 &times; (4 + 5)
  
  Can be solved as:
  -> 3 &times; 4 + 3 &times; 5
  -> 12 + 15
  -> 27
  OR
  -> 3 &times; (9)
  -> 27
  </pre>
  ### Note:
  + Standard order of operations would lead one to resolve the contents of parentheses before multiplying. Therefore, the distributive property is most commonly put to use when the items inside the parentheses cannot be resolved because they are not like terms (e.g. a number and a variable, like 4 + x)
  + Multiplication is distributive over addition, but not vice versa.
