## Eigenvalue

An Eigenvalue is a special scalar [mathworld.wolfram.com](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Eigenvalue.html) that is associated with a linear system of equations (for example a matrix equation). They are sometimes also known as characteristic roots, characteristic values, proper values or latent roots. 

A good introduction to Eigenvalues,Eigenvectors and their uses can be found here [Khanacademy.org](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/alternate-bases/eigen-everything/v/linear-algebra-introduction-to-eigenvalues-and-eigenvectors)
