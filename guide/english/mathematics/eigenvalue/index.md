## Eigenvalue

This is a special set of scaler quantities associated with linear system of equations(i.e. matrix equations). In case of linear transformations, it is the scaling factor of a vector(column matrix) when a linear transformations is applied on it.

Let **A** be a linear transformation or a matrix equation represented by a matrix **A**. If there is a **non-zero, n-dimentional vector x** such that

**Ax = 位x**

then **位** is called the eigenvalue and **x** is called the eigenvector.

By solving **Ax = 位x** corresponding eigenvalues and respective eigenvector can be found. Note that these eigenvalues sometimes can be complex values.

## Method of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors
1. Solve **det(A - 位I) = 0** to find the eigenvalues.
2. Substitute each eigenvalue to original equation to get the respective eigenvector.

Example

This can be easily applied on any square matrix of order nxn.
