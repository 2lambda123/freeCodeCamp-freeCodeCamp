## Imaginary Numbers

An Imaginary Number "i" is defined simply as the square root of -1. In other words i<sup>2</sup> = -1. One of the reasons you would use Imaginary Numbers (or Complex Numbers as some others call them) is so that you can manipulate equations or expressions that contain the square root of -1. 

## Geometric information
Geometrically, imaginary numbers are found on the vertical axis of the complex number plane, allowing them to be presented perpendicular to the real axis. One way of viewing imaginary numbers is to consider a standard number line, positively increasing in magnitude to the right, and negatively increasing in magnitude to the left. At 0 on this x-axis, a y-axis can be drawn with "positive" direction going up; "positive" imaginary numbers then increase in magnitude upwards, and "negative" imaginary numbers increase in magnitude downwards. This vertical axis is often called the "imaginary axis" and is denoted iℝ, I {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \mathbb {I} } \scriptstyle \mathbb {I} , or ℑ.
