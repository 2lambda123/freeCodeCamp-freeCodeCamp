## What a P Value Tells You About Statistical Data

The p-value is a value calculated through hypothesis testing which tells us the significance of the statistical data. It is a probability of how frequently the observed differece (or a larger difference) would occur due to random sampling error when the null hypothesis is true.

A low p-value (usually <0.05) shows strong evidence that the null hypothesis is false. This tells us that the data did not happen by chance. We would reject the null hypothesis and suggest that the alternative hypothesis may be true. 

A moderate p-value (usually 0.10>0.05) shows weak evidence that the null hypothesis is false. A p-value above 0.10 would show no evidence that the null hypothesis is false.
