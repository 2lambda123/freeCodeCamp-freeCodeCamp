## Euler's Formula

Euler's Formula is a mathematical identity which states that, for any value of <em>x</em> (and where <em>e</em> is the base of the natural logarithm and <em>i</em> is the square root of -1):

 <em>e</em><sup><em>ix</em></sup> = cos <em>x</em> + <em>i</em> sin <em>x</em>

Furthermore, when <em>x</em> = <em>&pi;</em>, Euler's Formula results in the following beautiful identity relating <em>&pi;</em>, <em>e</em>, and <em>i:</em>

 <em>e</em><sup><em>i&pi;</em></sup> + 1 = 0

A famous joke for mathematicians answers the question "How many mathematicians does it take to change a light bulb?" with "<em>-e</em><sup><em>i&pi;</em></sup>".
