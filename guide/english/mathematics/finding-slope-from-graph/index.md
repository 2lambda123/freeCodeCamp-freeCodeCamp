## Finding Slope from Graph

The slope from a graph measure the rate of change of the function represented by the graph. In it's simplest form, the slope can be calculated by dividing the change in the y-axis by the change in the x-axis. This can be done by choosing two points on the graph. From those two points, the slope can be calulated as such:

The rate of change (slope) of a function, is also known as the Derivative of a function. This is an extremely useful metric to calculate, and can be used to find minimum and maximum values that are helpful for things such as optimization.
