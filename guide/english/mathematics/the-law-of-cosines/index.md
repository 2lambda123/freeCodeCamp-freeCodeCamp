## The Law of Cosines

In [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines), the **law of cosines** (also known as the **cosine formula** or **cosine rule**) relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. Using notation as in Fig. 1, the law of cosines states

where *γ* denotes the angle contained between sides of lengths *a* and *b* and opposite the side of length *c*.

Fig. 1: A triangle. The angles *α* (or *A*), *β* (or *B*), and *γ* (or *C*) are respectively opposite the sides *a*, *b*, and *c*.

The law of cosines generalizes the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem), which holds only for right triangles if the angle *γ* is a right angle (of measure 90 °degrees, or pi/2 radians), then *cos γ =0*, and thus the law of cosines reduces to the Pythagorean theorem:

The law of cosines is useful for computing the third side of a triangle when two sides and their enclosed angle are known, and in computing the angles of a triangle if all three sides are known.
