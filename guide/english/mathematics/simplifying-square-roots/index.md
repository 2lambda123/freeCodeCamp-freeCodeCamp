## Simplifying Square Roots

<h1>Simplifying Square Roots </h1>
<p>Let's say you have the radical &radic;363, and you need to simplify it into a both, simplest number, and a number that you can use in specific calculations, where we can do this by trying to find perfect squares within the radical. </p>

<p>So, it's a fact that: </p>
<p>&radic;(x &times; y) = &radic;x &times; &radic;y</p>
<p> and this fact allows us to understand that we can seperate the &radic;xy into two separate radicals, &radic;x and &radic;y. </p>

<p>But first, we need to find a factor of 363, that would allow us to pull a perfect square from it.
Perfect square numbers include: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144 etc. ,as each of them can become a whole number if these numbers were square rooted.</p>

<p>Now, factors of 363 are: 1, 3, 11, 33, 121 and 363 </p>

If you look, you can see that 121 is among that list, 121&times;3 is 363, and we can change the radical to show that:
<p>&radic;363 = &radic;(121&times;3) = &radic;121 &times; &radic;3 </p>
And we can take the square root of 121, where we can turn it into a whole number:
<p>= 11 &times; sqrt(3) </p>
<p> Hence, 11&radic;3 is the square root number of 363. </p>

Simplifying Square roots in the Denominator:
<p> Lets' say you have the expression: </p>
<p> <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>&radic;5</sub> </p>
<p> And you wanted to simplify this by removing the radical from the denominator, well you can do this by multiplying this fraction by: </p>
<p> <sup>&radic;5</sup>&frasl;<sub>&radic;5</sub> </p>
<p> Which is equal to one, and you get: </p>
<p> <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>&radic;5</sub> &times; <sup>&radic;5</sup>&frasl;<sub>&radic;5</sub> 
          = <sup>2&radic;5</sup> &frasl; <sub>5</sub> </p>   
<p> because a square root multiplied by itself is the number in the square, the denominator is now a whole number, not a radical anymore. The radical still exists in the top, but this is fine in most cases, as the value itself is still exact. </p>
