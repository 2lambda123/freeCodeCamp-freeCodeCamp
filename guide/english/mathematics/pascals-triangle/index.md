## Pascals Triangle

Pascals Triangle is a neverending numerical triangle in which the top two outside edges are made of *1*s and all the inner numbers are created by adding the two numbers that occur to the top left and top right together. Here is an example of a 4 row Pascals Triangle:

**Note: When counting rows, you skip the first one**

Pascals triangle has two main uses, one is for binomial expansions, while the other is finding patterns within pascals triangle. Such patterns are triangular numbers, the fibonacci sequence, powers of 2, exponents of 11 and so on.

Pascal's Triangle can also show you how many ways heads and tails can combine. This can then show you the probability of any combination.

For example, if you toss a coin three times, there is only one combination that will give you three heads (HHH), but there are three that will give two heads and one tail (HHT, HTH, THH), also three that give one head and two tails (HTT, THT, TTH) and one for all Tails (TTT). This is the pattern "1,3,3,1" in Pascal's Triangle.
