The surface area <em>A</em> of a sphere with radius <em>r</em> may be calculated by the formula <em>A</em> = 4<em>&pi;r</em><sup>2</sup>, where <em>&pi;</em> is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (<em>&pi;</em> &approx; 3.14159).

### Example:
<em>Problem:</em> Given a sphere with a radius of 11 inches, find its surface area.

<em>Solution: A</em> = 4&times;<em>&pi;</em>&times;11<sup>2</sup> &approx; 1520.5 square inches
