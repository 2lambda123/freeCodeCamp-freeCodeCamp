## Adding and Subtracting Negative Numbers

Adding and subtracting positive numbers is fairly straighforward, but what does it mean to add and subtract negative numbers? Let's look at a real world example to get a better idea. Suppose we have a basket with some balloons tied to it pushing it upward and some weights tied to it pushing it down. Think of the force pulling the balloon up as a positive number and the force pulling it down as a negative number. If we add more weights, it's like we're adding a negative number and the basket gets pulled down. If we remove weights, we are subtracting a negative number and the basket gets pulled up.

### Examples

1. (-1) + 3 = 3 - 1 = 2

2. (-3) + (-3) = -6

3. (-2) - 4 = (-2) + (-4) = -6

4. (-10) + 2 = 2 - 10 = -8

5. 20 + (-44) = 20 - 44 = -24
