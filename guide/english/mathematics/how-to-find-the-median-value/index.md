## How to Find the Median Value

Say you have the following numbers: 21, 8, 10, 15, 4, 7, 8, 12, 7, 10

Step 1 - Put the numbers in ascending order: 4, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10, 10, 12, 15, 21
Step 2 - Find the number in the middle: here, the no. is the mean between 8 and 10, that is 9. If we had an odd list, than the calculation of the mean was not necessary.

Thus, thw median is 9 for that example.
