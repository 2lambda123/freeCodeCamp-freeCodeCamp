The P value is the probability of finding the observed results when the null hypothesis is true. It allows us to determine the significance of the results of a hypothesis that we have performed.

The p-value is a number between 0 and 1 and interpreted in the following way:

A small p-value (typically â‰¤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, therefore you reject the null hypothesis.

A large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, therefore you fail to reject the null hypothesis.
