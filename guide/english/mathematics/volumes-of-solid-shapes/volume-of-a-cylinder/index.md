## Volume of a Cylinder

A cylinder is a 3-dimensional object  with a circular base and straight, parallel sides.<br>
To find the volume and surface area, all we need is the radius (r), height (h), and pi (π).

#### Volume
The volume of a cylinder is calculated by multiplying the area of the base by the height.<br>
Because the base of a cylinder is a circle, we must find the area using the following formula:

  Area of a Circle = πr<sup>2</sup>

We then multiply this by the the height of the cylinder to get the formula for the total area:

  Volume = πr<sup>2</sup>h
