## Area of Trapezoids

The area of a trapezoid is defined as 

<img src="https://ncalculators.com/images/formulas/trapezium.jpg" alt="trapezoid area">

** A = (a+b)/2 x h ** 

Where, 

a,b are the lengths of each base

h is the altitude (height)

#### Example Problem :
Find the area of a trapezoid having the bottom length a = 15 cm, top length b = 12 & height h = 9 cm?

Solution :

The given values

bottom length a = 8 cm

top length b = 6 cm

height h = 4 cm

Step by step calculation

formula to find area = ((a + b)/2)*h

substitute the values

= ((8 + 6)/2) x 4

= 28 cm2
