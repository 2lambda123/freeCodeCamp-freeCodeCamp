## Area of Triangles

The area of a triangle is the total enclosed space on the two-dimensional plane by the sides of the triangle.

### Method 1
One method of finding the area of a triangle is by using this formula below:

![Formula 1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Area%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Ctimes%20height%20%5Ctimes%20base)

![Triangle](http://www.mathportal.org/calculators/plane-geometry-calculators/triangleEquilateral.gif)

For example in the image above, AB represents the length of the base, which has the value of a units. On the other hand, the perdendicular height, h, represents the height of the triangle ABC. In this case, the area of this triangle will be calculated through:

![Formula 1 applied](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Area%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Ctimes%20a%20%5Ctimes%20h)

### Example 1
For example, if you have a triangle that is 3cm on the base and 4cm as the perpendicular height, then you can work out the area by using the formula from above, which will show:

![Example 1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Area%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Ctimes%203cm%20%5Ctimes%204cm%20%3D%206cm%5E2)

### Terminology
* Base (b) - The length of one side of the triangle.
* Height (h) - The length of a line perpendicular with the base to the opposite point of the triangle.

### Method 2
Although, method 1 is a common method of using its formula to find the area of a triangle in primary school and junior high school levels, not all triangles will fit the criteria of having a base that is perpendicular to the height, which represents a scalene triangle. Hence, the second method of finding the area of a triangle is achieved through this:

![Formula 2.1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Area%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Ctimes%20a%20%5Ctimes%20b%20%5Ctimes%20sinC)

![Formula 2.2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Area%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Ctimes%20a%20%5Ctimes%20c%20%5Ctimes%20sinB)

![Formula 2.3](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Area%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Ctimes%20b%20%5Ctimes%20c%20%5Ctimes%20sinA)

**Note:** In the formula, the angle that is chosen needs to use the two sides that is creating that specific angle.

### Example 2

![Example 2](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/images/trig-areaex2.gif)

In the image above, we are required to calculate this area of triangle, where there is a side of 150m and a side of 231m, with an angle of 123 degrees in between. We can use the formula above to solve the problem to its nearest cm squared through:

### Method 3

Given that scalene triangles do exists, there is a possibility that there is a triangle where the values are only given to the sides of the triangle. In this situation, we can use the Heron's Formula, which involves this:

![Triangle 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Triangle_ABC_with_Sides_a_b_c.png)

**Step 1** \
Calculating half of the perimeter of the triangle, which represents the value of 's':

![Formula of s](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?s%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Ba&plus;b&plus;c%7D%7B2%7D)

**Step 2** \
Using the 's' value to calculate the area through:

![Formula of Triangle 3](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Area%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7Bs%28s-a%29%28s-b%29%28s-c%29%7D)

### Example 3

![Example 3](https://www.math-only-math.com/images/side-properties-of-triangles.png)

In the example above, there is a triangle with side lengths of 5cm, 7cm and 8cm. Firstly, we will calculate the value of 's' through:

![Step 1 of Example 3](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?s%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B5%20&plus;%207%20&plus;%208%7D%7B2%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B20%7D%7B2%7D%20%3D%2010)

Given that we now know the value of s is equal to 10, we can finally apply the formula to find the area of the triangle, which is below here (nearest cm squared with 1 decimal place):

![Step 2 of Example 3](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Area%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7B10%2810-5%29%2810-7%29%2810-8%29%7D%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7B10%285%29%283%29%282%29%7D%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7B300%7D%20%3D%2017.3cm%5E2)
