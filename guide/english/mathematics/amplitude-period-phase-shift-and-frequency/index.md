## Amplitude Period Phase Shift and Frequency

Amplitude:
The Amplitude is the height from the center line to the peak (or to the trough). Or we can measure the height from highest to lowest points and divide that by 2.

Period:
The Period goes from one peak to the next (or from any point to the next matching point).

Phase Shift:
The Phase Shift is how far the function is shifted horizontally from the usual position.
