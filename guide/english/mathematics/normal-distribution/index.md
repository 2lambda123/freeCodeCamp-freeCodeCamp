## Normal Distribution

Normal distributions (also called Gaussian distributions) appear frequently in nature and are the basis of many statistical analyses. The data points of a random variable X form a bell shaped curve. This is largely a consequence of Central Limit Theorem. 

A good introduction to Normal distributions can be found here [Khanacademy.org](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data/more-on-normal-distributions/v/introduction-to-the-normal-distribution)
