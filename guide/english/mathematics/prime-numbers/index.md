## Prime Numbers

A prime number is any number greater than 1 that can only be divided evenly by 1 or itself. If it can be divided by another number, then it is a composite number.

Examples:

5 is a prime number because it can only be divided evenly by itself(5), and 1.

12 is a not a prime number as it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

The first ten prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.

## SemiPrimes

 A semiprime (also called biprime or 2-almost prime, or pq number) is a natural number that is the product of two (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers.

Semiprimes that are not perfect squares are called discrete, or distinct, semiprimes.

By definition, semiprime numbers have no composite factors other than themselves. For example, the number 26 is semiprime and its only factors are 1, 2, 13, and 26.
