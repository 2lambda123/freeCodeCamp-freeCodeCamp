Coterminal angles are, in short, angles that share a terminal side. As there are 360 degrees in a circle, an angle A is coterminal with another angle B if A = B + (*K* * 360), where *K* is any integer. The logic behind this is that if you were to start at A and go one full rotation around the circle, you would end up back at A, as you would if you went 2, 5, or 10,000 rotations around the circle. Therefore, if you started at 0 and traveled B + (*K* * 360) degrees clockwise, you would end up at A.

*K* as mentioned above can be negative. In this case, the coterminal angle will be negative. This still makes sense, as if you start at 0 degrees and travel B + (*K* * 360) **counterclockwise**, you will end up at A.
