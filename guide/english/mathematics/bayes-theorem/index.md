## Bayes Theorem

Bayes' theorem, named after 18th-century British mathematician Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. <br/>
The theorem provides a way to revise existing predictions or theories given new or additional evidence. <br/>
In finance, Bayes' theorem can be used to rate the risk of lending money to potential borrowers.



Bayesâ€™ Theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities.

The formula is:

Which tells us:	 	how often A happens given that B happens, written P(A|B), <br/>
When we know:	 	how often B happens given that A happens, written P(B|A)      <br/>
 	 	and how likely A is on its own, written P(A)                             <br/>
 	 	and how likely B is on its own, written P(B)                                 <br/>
