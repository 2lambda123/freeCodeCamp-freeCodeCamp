## Bayes Theorem

Bayes' theorem  play an important part in statistics. It can be derived from the basic conditional probability. Bayes' theorem tells that, for two events A and B, the probability of both happening is given by,

        P(B/A) = {P(A/B)*P(B)}/P(A) & P(A/B) = {P(B/A)*P(A)}/P(B)
        
Where P(A/B) is the probability of A if we already know that B has occurred and is known as likelihood, P(B) is known as prior probability and P(B/A)is posterior probability.
