## Area of a Rectangle

The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the lengths of the two perpendicular sides together.

`Area = a x b`

## Proprties of a Rectangle

1. Each of the interior angles of a rectangle is 90.
2. The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other.
3. The opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel.
4. The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.

**For Example**
For a rectangle where *a = 3* and *b = 4*

`Area = a x b = 3 x 4 = 12`
