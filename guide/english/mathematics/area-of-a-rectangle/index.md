title: Area of a Rectangle
---

## Rectangle

 A **rectangle** is a quadrilateral with four right angles. <br/>
 It can also be defined as an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its angles are equal (360°/4 = 90°).   <br/>
 It can also be defined as a parallelogram containing a right angle.   <br/>
 A rectangle with four sides of equal length is a square.

## Area of a Rectangle

The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the lengths of the two perpendicular sides together.

`Area = length x width`

**For Example**
For a rectangle where *length = 3* and *width = 4*

`Area = length x width = 3 x 4 = 12`
