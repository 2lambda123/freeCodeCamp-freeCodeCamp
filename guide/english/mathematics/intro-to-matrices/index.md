## Intro to Matrices
A matrices is composed by a 2D array, or better, a rectangular array. Below you can see how its organized.

It is composed by rows, and columns. So if you want the number 7 of the matrix below, you need to get the element on the posicion (2,3), second row, third column.

The usuals operations works for matrices, but adddiotion and subtraction is made on the elements of the same position (so the two matrices needs to have the same size). Multiplication is different so matrix A x matrix B, A needs to have the same size of transpose of B. 

Transpose is the operations of inver the rows and columns of a matrix.

#### Types of Matrices
1. Square Matrix- A matrix with equal no. of rows and columns is called a square matrix.

2. Diagonal Matrix- A square matrix with only diagonal elements as non-zero elements. For example:

3. Scalar Matrix- A diagonal matrix is said to be scalar if all of its diagonal elements are the same.

4. Identity Matrix- A diagonal matrix is said to be identity if all of its diagonal elements are equal to one, denoted by I.

5. Triangular Matrix: A square matrix is said to be triangular if all of its elements above the principal diagonal are zero (lower triangular matrix) or all of its elements below the principal diagonal are zero (upper triangular matrix).
