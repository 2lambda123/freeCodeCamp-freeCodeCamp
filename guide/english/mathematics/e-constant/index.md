## E Constant

The E constant, named after Leonhard Euler, is equal to the value:
2.718281828
e is the base of the Natural Logarithms, and this kind of math is applicable in many areas of mathematics and physics, and any natural logarithm, if you are to encounter one, is solved similarly to any other logarithm.

But why does "e" matter? 
E is a constant which we can use to observe the behavior of exponential functions. E^x resembles many other exponential curves.
Furthermore, the inverse of e^x is ln(x), the base logarithmic function. 
OF particular importance, ln(e) = 1.

E is also equivalent to continuous compounding - basically the fastest rate of growth in nature.  You could have a savings account and have the interest compounded yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or by the day.  If you keep making the interval smaller you will find out that the the maximum interest earned through continuous compounding that a $1 can grow to is $2.718.
