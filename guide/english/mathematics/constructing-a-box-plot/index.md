## Constructing a Box Plot
Box plots, also called box-and-whisker plots, are representations of data for a single variable. When you have a collection of numerical data, you can find the median, minimum, maximum, upper quartile, and lower quartile, and make a box plot. You make a box above a number line with one end at the points of the upper and lower quartiles, and a line inside at the median. You then make lines at the minimum and maximum and draw lines to the nearest edge of the box.

Box plots are particularly useful for determining where outliers in a dataset could be having a disproportionate effect on the mean. Many statistical software packages include tools to create box plots as a standard tool, they are also available in Microsoft Excel. 

A good introduction on how to construct and interpret box plots can be found here [Khanacademy.org](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/data-distributions-a1/box--whisker-plots-a1/v/constructing-a-box-and-whisker-plot)
