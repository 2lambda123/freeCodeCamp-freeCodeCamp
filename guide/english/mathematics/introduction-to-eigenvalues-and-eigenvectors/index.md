## Introduction to Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

A**v** = λ**v** (1)

where A is a square matrix, **v** is a vector and λ is some eigenvalue that scales the eigenvector **v**.

Equation (1) describes a matrix-vector multiplication that ends up scaling the eigenvector **v** by an eigenvalue of λ.

The linear transformation performed by matrix A on **v** (where **v** is a non-zero column vector), only changes **v** by a scalar amount.

In other words, the direction of **v** remains in the same null space after being transformed by matrix A.
