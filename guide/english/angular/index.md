## Angular

AngularJS (versions 1.x) is a JavaScript based open source Framework. It is cross platform and used to develop Single Page Web Application (SPWA). AngularJS implements the MVC pattern to separate the logic , presentation and data components. It also uses dependency injection to make use of server-side services in client side applications.

Angular(versions 2.x and up) is a Typescript based open source framework to develop front-end Web application. Angular has following features like generics, static-typing (typescript) and the latest ES6 features.

Since the changes of version 2 is entirely different the version 1. Angular team decided to call Angular js version 1.X as `ANGULAR JS` and version greater than 2 ( i.e Angular 2.X and above) as Angular. So if you get heared as ANGULAR probably its version is 2 or above.
