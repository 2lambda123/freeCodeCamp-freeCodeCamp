# Computational Genomics

A new field that specializes in developing new algorithms in order to study the human genome.

This section will focus on the various data structures and algorithms that are used and created for this purpose from suffix arrays to sequence alignment. 

## BLAST

A very useful tool for bioinformatics, BLAST, the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, is an important part of the U.S. National Library of Medicine's online database. BLAST has five main search functions:

* Nucleotide BLAST: insert nucleotide sequence and it will search for all the data surrounding it.
* Protein BLAST: same as Nucleotide BLAST, but with Proteins.
* BlastX: insert a translated nucleotide sequence, and it will attempt to search for information on its respective protein.
* tblastn: the reverse process of BlastX.
* BLAST Genomes: look up the genomes of any species available.

You can access it online via the [BLAST website](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)
