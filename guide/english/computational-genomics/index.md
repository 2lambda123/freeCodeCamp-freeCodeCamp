A new field that specializes in developing new algorithms in order to study the human genome.

This section will focus on the various data structures and algorithms that are used and created for this purpose from suffix arrays to sequence alignment. 


## Books to read

Introduction to Computational Genomics by Matthew W. Hahn

A great starter book for beginners 

## Additional Resources
This blog by astrobiologist [Mike Lee](https://astrobiomike.github.io/) is a good place to start.  
Bioinformatics tools are commonly designed in R and Python.  Two such projects are the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) project (written in R) and the [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) project.
