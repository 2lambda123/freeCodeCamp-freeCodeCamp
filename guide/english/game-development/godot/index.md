## Godot Engine

Godot is a free game engine. It consists of a graphical editor in which game elements are organized in a tree structure and arranged on a 2D or 3D canvas. Game logic is usually implemented in GDScript, an integrated scripting language of its own that has been specially adapted to the needs of game engines.
