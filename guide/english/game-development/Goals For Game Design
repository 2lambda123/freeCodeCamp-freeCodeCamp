title: Goals
---

Game developer and theorist Jesper Juul defines goals as the elements in a game that players have to strive toward. [1] Goals assign value to a game’s possible outcomes, and games can either have required or optional goals. [2] In Juul’s definition, “the goal refers to the game as an activity, not to the game as an object.” [3] Game scholars don’t always agree on definitions. To Juul, games are an activity, but to Salen and Zimmerman, games are objects. There isn’t a right or wrong way to define games; it’s just important to understand that Juul views games as the action of playing, and Salen and Zimmerman view games as the object of the game itself.

Rules of Play adds that clear goals and outcomes often distinguish a game from play. [4] If you add a goal to play, you can create a game. For example, if one skier skis down a mountain, it’s a type of play. If two skiers agree to race down the mountain, it’s a game. [5] Their agreement to race enters them into the magic circle, and the goal of the race is to ski to the bottom of the mountain the fastest.

Rules define a game’s goals, and the goals define the endpoint of the game. [6] In the skiing example, the goal is to reach the bottom of the mountain first. A rule to help define the goal would set the exact location of the finish line. The goal also defines the endpoint of the game in this example, because when players reach the bottom of the mountain, they have completed the game.

## Types of Goals

Goals are important because they can transform play into a game, and they provide players challenges to try to reach. Goals need to be set at the correct challenge level for the players. If a goal is not challenging enough, players will become bored and disinterested. If a goal is too challenging, players will become frustrated and may give up playing the game. If a goal has the right amount of challenge for the player, it creates a state of flow. Flow will be discussed later in this unit.

There are three types of goals:

    long-term goals
    medium-term goals
    short-term goals.

## Long-Term Goals

A long-term goal is usually the goal that signals the end of the game. When you reach the long-term goal, the game is over. When the game ends, the magic circle disappears.

Examples of long-term goals include:

    defeating the Archdemon in Dragon’s Age 2
    defeating Kane in Command and Conquer
    tracking down the killer and confronting him in Heavy Rain
    retiring to a simple life in Red Dead Redemption
    defeating Shepard in Modern Warfare: Call of Duty 2.

## Short-Term Goals

Short-term goals are goals a player meets repeatedly during gameplay. Short-term goals are usually related to the game’s core mechanics. They can be met quickly, so players feel a sense of achievement and meaningful play while they’re working toward the long-term goal. Short-term goals help keep players engaged and provide guidance. Without short-term goals, a player can get lost in the game environment.

Examples of short-term goals include:

    taking down an enemy in Medal of Honor
    finding an artifact in Drake’s Fortune
    stealing a car in Grand Theft Auto
    choosing a horse in Red Dead Redemption
    submitting a successful word in Scrabble.

## Medium-Term Goals

Medium-term goals fall between short-term and long-term goals. They usually build toward the long-term goal. Medium-term goals cannot be performed instantly, but also don’t end the game. Think of medium-term goals as the goal needed to complete a level in a game. The goal for a level is between the smaller goals in the level and a larger-scale goal at the end of the game.

Examples of medium-term goals include:

    taking down a boss
    gaining a level in an RPG
    getting the flag back to base in a first-person shooter
    hitting a checkpoint in a racing game
    defeating an incoming rush in an RTS.

There are two other less common types of goals. Optional goals do not have to be completed to advance in the game. San Andreas is a game with optional goals. There is a long-term goal, but the player can choose how to approach it. The Sims has many short-term goals but they are all optional. The Sims will run without player interaction, so the goals are not required, and there is no clear long-term goal.

Another type of goal is called player-controlled. Sometimes players generate short-term goals for themselves. Player-controlled goals are generally optional. Players may decide to improve their avatar or complete other goals unrelated to the long-term goal of the game. For example, a Pokémon player may decide to move his Meowth up to level 50.

All goals should support meaningful play. Players need to care about completing a goal in order to have a meaningful experience completing it.
