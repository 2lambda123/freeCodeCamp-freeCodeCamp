## Docker build

`docker build` creats a docker image from a Dockerfile and a "context". A context can be a URL or a local PATH. You can name the image using the optional `-t` tag.

A Dockerfile will install dependencies during the build command, from a specified URL or local PATH. Any dependencies necessary in your containers must be specified in the Dockerfile.

Your image is now stored in your machineâ€™s local Docker image registry.

When you have Docker containers built, you can then run your app using the appropriate run commands.

For example: Running considering docker file exists in current directory, you can create a local docker image as below,

```html
docker build -t sampleimage:sampletag .
```

Here the sampleimage can be a string or a repository URL. If it is URL then it can be pushed to that repository targeted by URL using <a href='https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/'>docker push</a> command.
