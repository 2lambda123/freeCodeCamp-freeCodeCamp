# What is Bokeh ?
Bokeh is a Python library for interactive visualization that targets web browsers for representation. This is the core difference between Bokeh and other visualization libraries. Bokeh can produce elegant and interactive visualization like D3.js with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

## Benefits:
* Bokeh allows you to build complex statistical plots quickly and through simple commands
* Bokeh provides you output in various medium like html, notebook and server
* We can also embed Bokeh visualization to flask and django app
* Bokeh can transform visualization written in other libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot
* Bokeh has flexibility for applying interaction, layouts and different styling option to visualization

## Challenges :
* Like with any upcoming open source library, Bokeh is undergoing a lot of development. So, the code you write today may not be entirely reusable in future.
* It has relatively less visualization options, when compared to D3.js. Hence, it is unlikely in near future that it will challenge D3.js for its crown.
