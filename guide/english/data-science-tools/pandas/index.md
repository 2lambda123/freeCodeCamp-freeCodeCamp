## pandas
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library for data analysis using data frames. Data frames are tables of data, which may conceptually be compared to a spreadsheet. Data scientists familiar with R will feel at home here. pandas is often used along with numpy, pyplot, and scikit-learn.

### Importing pandas
It is a widely used convention to import the pandas library using the alias `pd`:
```python
import pandas as pd
```

## Data frames
A data frame consist of a number of rows and column. Each column represents a feature of the data set, and so has a name and a data type. Each row represents a data point through associated feature values. The pandas library allows you to manipulate the data in a data frame in various ways. pandas has a lot of possibilities, so the following is merely scratching the surface to give a feel for the library.
## Series
Series is the basic data-type in pandas.A Series is very similar to a array (NumPy array) (in fact it is built on top of the NumPy array object).A Series can have axis labels, as it can be indexed by a label with no number indexing for the location of data.  It can hold any valid Python Object like List,Dictionary etc.

## Loading data from a csv file
A `.csv` file is a *comma separated value* file. A very common way to store data. To load such data into a pandas data frame use the `read_csv` method:
```python
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```
Here, `file_path` can be a local path to a csv file on you computer, or a url pointing to one. The column names may be included in the csv file, or the may be passed as an argument. For more on this, and much more, take a look at the [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html?highlight=read_csv#pandas.read_csv).

## Getting an overview of a data frame
To show the first few rows of a data frame, the `head` method is useful (once more this should sound familiar to R programmers):
```python
df.head()
```
This will show the first 5 rows of the data frame.

To show more than first 5 rows simply put the number of rows you want to print out inside the `head` method.
```python
df.head(10)
```
This will show the first 10 rows of the data frame.

To show the last few rows of a data frame, the `tail` method is useful (once more this should sound familiar to R programmers):
```python
df.tail()
```
This will show the last 5 rows of the data frame.

## Subsetting: Getting a column by name
A data frame can be subset in many ways. One of the simplest is getting a single column. For instance, if the data frame `df` contains a column named `age`, we can extract it as follows:
```python
ages=df["age"]
```
## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a very important step in data analysis. For example, we always check for missing values in the data by running pd.isnull() which checks for null Values, and returns a boolean array (an array of true for missing values and false for non-missing values). In order to get a sum of null/missing values, run pd.isnull().sum(). pd.notnull() is the opposite of pd.isnull(). After you get a list of missing values you can get rid of them, or drop them by using df.dropna() to drop the rows or df.dropna(axis=1) to drop the columns. A different approach would be to fill the missing values with other values by using df.fillna(x) which fills the missing values with x (you can put there whatever you want) or s.fillna(s.mean()) to replace all null values with the mean (mean can be replaced with almost any function from the statistics section).

It is sometimes necessary to replace values with different values. For example, s.replace(1,'one') would replace all values equal to 1 with 'one'. Itâ€™s possible to do it for multiple values: s.replace([1,3],['one','three']) would replace all 1 with 'one' and 3 with 'three'. You can also rename specific columns by running: df.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_ name'}) or use df.set_index('column_one') to change the index of the data frame.
