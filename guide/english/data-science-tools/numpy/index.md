## Numpy
NumPy (or Numpy) is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks.
Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries.

## Installation
To install scikit-learn in a conda environment: `conda install -c anaconda numpy `
