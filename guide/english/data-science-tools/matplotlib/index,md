## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is the "grandfather" library of data visualization with Python. It was created by John Hunter. He created it to try to replicate MatLab's (another programming language) plotting capabilities in Python.
Some of the major Pros of Matplotlib are:

* Generally easy to get started for simple plots
* Support for custom labels and texts
* Great control of every element in a figure
* High-quality output in many formats
* Very customizable in general

## Installation
