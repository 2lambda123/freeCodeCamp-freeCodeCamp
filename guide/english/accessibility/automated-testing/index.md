Accessibility is all about making applications accessible for people who have impairments. It covers people with visual, auditory, or other cognitive impairments.At least one in five people have some type of impairment, so it’s very important to have them in mind when developing software.As we are developing our applications, we should keep these folks in mind as we test to ensure that our software is accessible for all our users.

Some examples of Automated Accessibility Testing Tools are:
- A11Y Compliance Platform: The platform gives tools, reports and services to help companies and organizations maintain and defend the web site’s accessibility and integrity.
- AATT (Automated Accessibility Testing Tool): This platform provides an accessibility API as well as other custom web applications for HTML CodeSniffer. This product is offered by PayPal
- DYNO Mapper: itemap generator that checks the web accessibility of websites and online applications. DYNO Mapper also includes content inventory and audit, as well as daily keyword tracking.
