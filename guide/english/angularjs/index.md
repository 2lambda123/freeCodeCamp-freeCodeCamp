## AngularJS

AngularJS (versions 1.x) is an open source front-end JavaScript framework. AngularJS extends HTML to develop rich and powerful front-ends. 
It reduces the repetitive use of HTML code. This repetition can be avoided by using the directives provided by AngularJS which saves 
much time and effort.

**Install**:

npm:

```shell 
npm install angular
```
HTML:

```html
<script src="/node_modules/angular/angular.js"></script>
```

bower:

```shell
bower install angular
```
HTML:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
```
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
