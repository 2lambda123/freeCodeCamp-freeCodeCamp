## AngularJS

AngularJS (versions 1.x) is an open source front-end JavaScript framework. AngularJS extends HTML to develop rich and powerful front-ends. 
It reduces the repetitive use of HTML code. This repetition can be avoided by using the directives provided by AngularJS which saves 
much time and effort.

## Scope

AngularJS uses the term "scope" in a manner akin to the fundamentals of computer science.

Scope in computer science describes when in the program a particular binding is valid. The ECMA-262 specification defines scope as: a lexical environment in which a Function object is executed in client-side web scripts;[7] akin to how scope is defined in lambda calculus.[8]

As a part of the "MVC" architecture, the scope forms the "Model", and all variables defined in the scope can be accessed by the "View" as well as the "Controller". The scope behaves as a glue and binds the "View" and the "Controller".

In AngularJS, "scope" is a certain kind of object[9] that itself can be in scope or out of scope in any given part of the program, following the usual rules of variable scope in JavaScript like any other object.[10] When the term "scope" is used below, it refers to the Angular scope object and not the scope of a name binding.
