## AngularJS

AngularJS (versions 1.x) is an open source front-end JavaScript framework. AngularJS extends HTML to develop rich and powerful front-ends. 
It reduces the repetitive use of HTML code. This repetition can be avoided by using the directives provided by AngularJS which saves 
much time and effort. It is cross platform and used to develop Single Page Web Application (SPWA). AngularJS implements the MVC pattern to separate the logic , presentation and data components. It also uses dependency injection to make use of server-side services in client side applications.
