## AngularJS

**AngularJS** (versions 1.x) is an open source front-end JavaScript framework mainly maintained by Google along with a community of individuals and other businesses. AngularJS extends HTML to develop rich and powerful front-ends. It aims to do this by simplifying both the development and testing of these applications/front-ends by providing a framework for client-side model-view-controller (MVC) and model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) architectures as well as components frequently used in application development.
It reduces the repetitive use of HTML code. This repetition can be avoided by using the directives provided by AngularJS which saves 
much time and effort.

## Process

1. Read the HTML page with additional embedded custom tag attributes.
2. Interpret these attributes as directives in order to bind input/output parts of the page to JavaScript variables that represent a model. These variables can be set manually within the code or retreived from either a static or dynamic JSON resource(s).

**Install**:

npm:

```shell 
npm install angular
```
HTML:

```html
<script src="/node_modules/angular/angular.js"></script>
```

bower:

```shell
bower install angular
```
HTML:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
```
