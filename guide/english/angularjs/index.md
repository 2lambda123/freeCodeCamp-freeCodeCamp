## AngularJS

AngularJS (versions 1.x) is an open source front-end JavaScript framework Developed by Google. AngularJS extends HTML and CSS to develop rich and powerful front-ends. 
It reduces the repetitive use of HTML code. This repetition can be avoided by using the directives provided by AngularJS which saves 
much time and effort. AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions.
