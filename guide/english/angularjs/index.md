## AngularJS

AngularJS (versions 1.x) is an open source front-end JavaScript framework mainly maintained by Google and a large community of developers. AngularJS extends HTML to develop rich and powerful front-ends. 
It reduces the repetitive use of HTML code. This repetition can be avoided by using the directives provided by AngularJS which saves 
much time and effort.
Released on May 11th 2018, AngularJS version 1.7.0 was the last one that included breaking changes. The active development on AngularJS continued until June 30, 2018. Since July 1st 2018, AngularJS 1.7 entered Long Term Support mode (LTS) which is scheduled to end on June 30, 2021. Until then, 1.7.x patch releases will continue to receive bug fixes and non-breaking features. The latest stable release of AngularJS (as of October 2018) is 1.7.5.
