## A Brief History of Markup & XML

  XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is extensible, because it does not use a predefined set of tags for
  identifying structural components, instead, it provides a mechanism for defining such sets of tags. The
  main purpose of the language is to share the data. Unlike HTML, in XML there is no predefined set of tags and 
  tags specify meaning, rather than the presentation.
  
Before XML was established as the preferred data format for applications, web applications were a
trove of key/value pairs and pipe-delimited strings, while desktop applications ventured into flat files, 
manifests, and compiled data files. Although both web and desktop applications could and did use databases,
there was no standard way of representing that data if you needed to describe it to an external agnostic program.
  

The history of XML is rooted in the early days of electronic manuscripts. 
Many of these manuscripts contained special macros used to format the document
in a specific way, but eventually, the late 1960’s gave rise to a movement towards generic coding with the use 
of descriptive elements (e.g., tags) for document formatting. It was William Tunnicliffe and the Graphic 
Communication Association’s (GCA) Composition Committee that started the move towards generic coding in order 
to promote a separation of content from formatting. Tunnicliffe presented this idea to the Canadian Government’s
Printing Office in 1967. Also at this time, Stanley Rice, a book designer from New York, was in the midst of
proposing an idea for editorial tags meant for structure. Later, Norman Scharpf, the director of the GCA, started 
a generic coding project inside of the Composition Committee of the GCA as a result of noticing trends towards this
generic markup. This committee created a GenCode(R) concept that established the idea that different generic codes 
would be necessary for different types of documents. This GenCode(R) concept eventually evolved into the GenCode Committee,
which had a large role in developing the Standardized Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
