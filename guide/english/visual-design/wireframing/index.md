# Wireframing

A wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a page’s interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors.

Wireframing is a way to design an application at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page for these reasons, wireframes typically do not include any styling, color, or graphics. Wireframes also help establish relationships between a website’s various templates.

Wireframing is an important step in the design process of any application. It allows you to design the hierarchy of the design. Wireframing makes it easier to plan the layout of how you want the user to process the information on your application. This makes a wireframe useful in determining user interaction and experience. Designer can then turn the wireframe into a visual so that the full scope of a project is known.
