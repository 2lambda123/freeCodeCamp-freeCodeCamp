## Operators


PHP contains all the normal operators one would expect to find in a programming language. 

A single “=” is used as the assignment operator and a double “==” or triple “===” is used for comparison. 

The usual “<” and “>” can also be used for comparison and “+=” can be used to add a value and assign it at the same time.

Most notable is the use of the “.” to concatenate strings and “.=” to append one string to the end of another. 


## PHP Arithmetic Operators

The arithmetic operators are used to perform common arithmetical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication etc. Here's a complete list of PHP's arithmetic operators:


+ 	Addition      	  $x + $y 	Sum of $x and $y
- 	Subtraction   	  $x - $y 	Difference of $x and $y.
* 	Multiplication  	$x * $y 	Product of $x and $y.
/ 	Division        	$x / $y 	Quotient of $x and $y
% 	Modulus         	$x % $y 	Remainder of $x divided by $y

## PHP Assignment Operators
The assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

=	    Assign            	        $x = $y 	$x = $y
+=	  Add and assign	            $x += $y	$x = $x + $y
-=	  Subtract and assign	        $x -= $y	$x = $x - $y
*=	  Multiply and assign	        $x *= $y	$x = $x * $y
/=  	Divide and assign quotient	$x /= $y	$x = $x / $y
%=	  Divide and assign modulus 	$x %= $y	$x = $x % $y
