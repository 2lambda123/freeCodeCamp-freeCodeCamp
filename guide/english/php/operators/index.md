## Operators

The following example will output the Pre-increment	Increments $x by one, then returns $x:
````php
<?php
$x = 10;  
echo ++$x;
?>
````

PHP contains all the normal operators one would expect to find in a programming language. 

A single “=” is used as the assignment operator and a double “==” or triple “===” is used for comparison. 

The usual “<” and “>” can also be used for comparison and “+=” can be used to add a value and assign it at the same time.

Most notable is the use of the “.” to concatenate strings and “.=” to append one string to the end of another.
