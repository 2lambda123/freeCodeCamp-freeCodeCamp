## Operators


Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

PHP divides the operators in the following groups:
<ul>
  <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
  <li>Assignment operators</li>
  <li>Comparison operators</li>
  <li>Increment/Decrement operators</li>
  <li>Logical operators</li>
  <li>String operators</li>
  <li>Array operators</li>
</ul>

PHP also contains all the normal operators one would expect to find in a programming language. 

A single “=” is used as the assignment operator and a double “==” or triple “===” is used for comparison. 

The usual “<” and “>” can also be used for comparison and “+=” can be used to add a value and assign it at the same time.

Most notable is the use of the “.” to concatenate strings and “.=” to append one string to the end of another.
