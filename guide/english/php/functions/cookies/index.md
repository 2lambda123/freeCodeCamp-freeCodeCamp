## Cookies

Definition: A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values. The name of the cookie is automatically assigned to a variable of the same name.
