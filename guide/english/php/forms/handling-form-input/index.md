title: Handling Form Input

## Handling Form Input
1. GET request will send the form input in the query string.
2. POST request will send the form input in the request body.

- One can get form inputs with global variables $_POST and $_GET.

If a user is sending username via form input, we can handle the request depending on the request type GET or POST.  
```
$_POST['username'] or $_GET['username'] 

```
