title: What Is A Mobile Application? 
---

Here’s the Wikipedia definition:

A mobile application (mobile app) is a software application designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers and other mobile devices.

So pretty straightforward then? Not quite.
The history of the mobile app begins, obviously, with the history of the mobile device and the first mobile phones whose microchips required the most basic of software to send and receive voice calls. But since then things have gotten a lot more complicated.
A mobile app is a software application. Basically, it is a computer generated program designed and developed to run on iPhones, Android phones, tablets or any other mobile devices. Without doubt, the world has accepted the fact that apps are the way to get the most from their smartphones. So, it will be riveting to trace the history of mobile apps development.

### Where Did It All Start?
On April 3rd, 1973, the first mobile phone call was made by Martin Cooper of Motorola to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs. That device or instrument weighed 1.1 kg and measured (23 x 13 x 4.45) cm. And, it took two decades of Research and development (R&D) to get the first mobile application for smartphones, and the credit goes to IBM Simon, who created the world's first mobile app for smartphones.

### What Makes Mobile Apps So Popular?
Most people have smartphones today, so apps are easy to access and simply make your life better as a result. There are millions of mobile apps at present. For example, apps for social networks, travel, health, banking, fitness, calendars, games, news and much more. The Apple App Store adds more than 20,000 apps every month.

### Mobile App Development Timeline 
Mobile application development is not only the leading business today, but it is also the bread earner for many individuals across the globe. Take WhatsApp; this small app was developed and revolutionized the global communication, and is now part of the biggest and arguably the most popular social network while at the same time it has rewarded its owners with millions of dollars. What business owners fail to realize when inquiring about app development are the timelines involved for both of the parties involved. Through this article, we intend to clarify the misconceptions clients have with the application development process. App development is not a child’s game; it requires a significant amount of critical thinking, research, and market analysis prior to development. All this takes time.

### How can you start making apps?
There are many tools at your disposal from which you can start making your own apps. The most popular is Android Studio which uses Java and XML. XCode lets you create apps for iOS. But these apps require a good amount of programming knowledge. For all the beginners out there, MIT AppInventor 2 comes to the rescue. With simple block-based programming one can easily code and make their own apps very easily and publish it for others.
