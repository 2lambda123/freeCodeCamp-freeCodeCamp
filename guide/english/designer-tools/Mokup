## Mokup

Mokup is a new up and comer in the UI designing software game. It's still new, so it's missing some features that may be important to a lot of people.
It doesn't allow for collaboration, but it is a free design tool with a lot of advanced features, so if you're a freelancer, it
might be a good idea to have this software. 

##### Why you should choose Mokup

- Advanced Transitions editor. Design complex and intriguing animations with ease.
- Symbols. Create one object for multiple use within Mokup.
- Cross Platform. Mokup can be installed and used on Windows, Mac, IOS and Android.
- Pixel perfect prototypes with snapping and alignment tools.
- Import PSD and SVG into your mokup files.
- Bindings. Enhance your prototypes with bindings, making interactions engaging.
- Mokup plays well with Figma. Copy and paste the link from your figma project into your mokup document.

Mokup has a familiar interface that will make it easy to use when designing with it. If you haven't used any UI prototyping tools before, you might have a little difficulty with navigating the interface.
