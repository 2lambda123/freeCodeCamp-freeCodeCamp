title: How to Get Help When You Are Stuck
---
When you get stuck, remember: Read-Search-Ask.

1.  **Read** the documentation or error
2.  **Search** Google 
  2b. There is also StackOverflow in case someone else had a similar issue.
3.  **Ask** your friends for help
  3b.  If you don't have friends who can help, find a FCC meet up in your area or check out the FCC Facebook page.

This is the most time-efficient way to handle being stuck, and it's the most respectful of other people's time, too.

Most of the time, you'll solve your problem after just one or two steps of this algorithm.

We have a special chat room just for getting help: <a href='https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/help/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/help/</a>
