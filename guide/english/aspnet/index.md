## ASP.NET

# Overview

ASP.Net is a web development platform provided by Microsoft. It is used for creating web-based applications and websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as front end. 
Server-side programming languages like C# and VB .NET may be used to code the back end.

ASP.NET offers different frameworks for creating web applications: For e.g Web Forms, Web Pages and ASP.NET MVC.


### Web Forms

Web Forms lets you build dynamic websites using a familiar drag-and-drop, event-driven model using a combination of HTML, server side code and controls. A design surface and hundreds of controls and components let you rapidly build sophisticated, powerful UI-driven sites with data access.



### Web Pages

Web Pages is a framework that you can use to create dynamic web pages by providing a fast, approachable, and lightweight way to combine server code with HTML. Connect to databases, add video, link to social networking sites, and include many more features that let you create beautiful sites using the latest web standards.



### ASP.NET MVC

MVC (Model-View-Controller) gives you a powerful patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and that gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development. MVC includes many features that enable fast, Test Driven Development (TDD)-friendly development for creating sophisticated applications that use the latest web standards.
