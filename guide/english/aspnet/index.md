## ASP.NET

# Overview

ASP.Net is a web development platform provided by Microsoft. 

## ASP.NET Core

Since 2016 (when v1.0 of [.NET Core was announced](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/06/27/announcing-net-core-1-0/)), there is an open source version, making it possible to develop cross-platform ASP.NET applications from Mac and Linux. 

It is used to create web-based applications and websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as front end. 
Server-side programming languages like C#, F# or VB .NET may be used to code the back end.
It offers different frameworks for creating web applications: For e.g Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC, or Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core. Also it's possible to create backend services for mobile or SPA applications, using the WepAPI tools from the framework.
