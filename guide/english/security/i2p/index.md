The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) was born in 2003. A group of hackers, developerts and software architects whose main objective was to create a virtual, private network, resistant to
censorship.

I2p differs from another popular anonymous network known as Tor in several ways that make it unique.  I2p was designed and optimized to be used for hidden services, while Tor is more focused on proxying to the regular Internet.  

Nearly all users of I2p are also routers for the network.  This is due to differences in bandwidth requirements between Tor and I2p. Since I2p requires less bandwidth many more peers participate.  

I2p supports TCP and UDP connections which make it useful for things like Bittorrent and VOIP.  The way I2p focuses on hidden service performance makes it a thriving environment for novel anonymous applications.
