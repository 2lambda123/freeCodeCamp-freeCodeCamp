Decentralized applications (dApps) are computer programs or applications developed to run on the P2P or dentralized network. There are dApps that work with blockchains (example: Ethereum) and those that do not (example: Bitorrent). These applications are designed not to have single points of failure and are resistant to various forms of disruption or attacks.

Blockchain based decentralized applications rely on trustless consensus protocols to verify and append transactions to a shared ledger. Entities that provide the computing power to sustain these dApps usually earn a reward in the form of network tokens or cryptocurrencies. 

dApps are open source projects and they are autonomously managed.
