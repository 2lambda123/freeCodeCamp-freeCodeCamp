Machine consensus is a computer science protocol to reliably and securely build decentralised databases on a peer-to-peer network where the transaction creators are not explicitly known. The protocol or algorithm decides if a transaction is valid and should be appended to a distributed ledger or blockchain.

Machine consensus algorithms need to be robustly designed to overcome crash and Byzantine failures. The key requirememts of these protocols include:
* Agreement: All valid transactions must agree on the same value
* Weak Validity: For each valid transaction, its output must be the input of another valid transaction
* Strong Validity: All valid transactions when provided the same input value must generate the same output value
* Termination: All transactions must settle on an output value

In addition, machine consensus algorithms need to be fault, attack and collusion resistant.
