Cryptocurrency is a subset of digital currency, which acts as a medium of exchange amongst two parties. It is known as crypto-currency because of the utilization of cryptography in securing its transactions. There are various cryptocurrencies including LiteCoin, Dash, Ethereum, Ripple, and the currently most popular one Bitcoin. It is the perfect way to make trustless and anonymous transactions since it does not involve any third party - there is no central bank. 

Unlike normal currency, cryptocurrency can be exchanged as fractions. For example, transactions can amount to 0.00007 BTC or even lower. Also, since blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are public and permissionless, anyone can access the entire history of transactions that have occurred since the inception of these cryptocurrencies. This public access enables transparency of data while maintaining privacy of users by enabling psuedonymous, disposable identities.

If you want to earn bitcoins through mining, it can be done through solving mathematical proof-of-work problems that validate transactions. Blockchain uses the concept of irreversible cryptographic hash function which consists of guessing a random number (usually less than a certain value) to solve the problem for transaction validation. This mechanism is called Proof-of-Work and is the way in which the blockchain creates consensus between all nodes. You will require machines with high processing power to be able to solve these problems (for example Fast-Hash One or CoinTerra TerraMiner IV). Computer's with a high end Graphics Card installed (such as the Nivida GTX 1080) are also able to solve these hashes effectively. More recently, specialized chips called ASICS have entered the market that are highly efficient at computing specific tasks while consuming less energy.
