Cryptocurrency is a subset of digital currency, which acts as a medium of exchange amongst two parties. It is known as crypto-currency because of the utilization of cryptography in securing its transactions. Cryptocurrencies mantain their record of transactions in a distributed ledger, making use of blockchain or similar technologies (as the tangle). With cryptocurriencies trustless transactions become possible since they do not involve any third party - there is no central bank.

Some examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Dash, Ethereum, and Ripple. A more complete list, with more than 2000, can be found in https://coinmarketcap.com/. Each of these cryptocurrencies offer the user a different set of features. Bitcoin is currently the most popular. In general it is possible to exchange fractions of cryptocurrencies. For example 1 bitcoin is divisible in 10**8 parts, meaning that the smallest unit, called a satoshi, would be 0.00000001 BTC.

If you want to earn bitcoins through mining, it can be done through solving mathematical proof-of-work problems that validate transactions. Blockchain uses the concept of irreversible cryptographic hash function which consists of guessing a random number (usually less than a certain value) to solve the problem for transaction validation. You will require machines with high processing power to be able to solve these problems (for example Fast-Hash One or CoinTerra TerraMiner IV). Computer's with a high end Graphics Card installed (such as the Nivida GTX 1080) are also able to solve these hashes effectively. 

As with traditional currencies, it is possible to invest in cryptocurrencies. This can be done through centralized exchanges, like Binance, Bitrex, or Coinbase; or decentralized ones like IDEX or EtherDelta. Cryptocurrency trading started to become noticeable around 2013, and the total market capitalization has been on the rise since then, peaking in January of 2018.
