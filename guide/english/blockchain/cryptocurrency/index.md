Cryptocurrency is a digital/virtual currency, which acts as a medium of exchange amongst two parties. The name "cryptocurrency" was coined on the basis of involvement of cryptography to strictly assure the security of transactions taking place on the network. Few examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Dash, Ethereum, and Ripple. Bitcoin is currently the most popular and valuable one.The sole purpose to bring up the concept of cryptocurrency was to remove the intervention of middlemen third parties in order to make te transactions more swift and secure , with the anonymity maintained for the all the users operating through their respective systems called 'nodes' on a network.

Cryptocurrency can be exchanged as fractions not possible with traditional currency. For example, transactions can amount to 0.00007 BTC or even lower.

If you want to earn bitcoins through mining, it can be done through solving mathematical proof-of-work problems that validate transactions.One needs to lend their computational power to arrive on a consensus and hence thereby validating the transaction on the blockchain network. Blockchain Technology uses the concept of irreversible cryptographic hash function which consists of guessing a random number (usually less than a certain value) to solve the problem for transaction validation. You will require machines with high processing power to be able to solve these problems (for example Fast-Hash One or CoinTerra TerraMiner IV). Computer's with a high end Graphics Card installed (such as the Nivida GTX 1080) are also able to solve these hashes effectively.
