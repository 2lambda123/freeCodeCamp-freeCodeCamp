## Smart Contracts

Transactions in a blockchain are a very basic contract - One party sends resources to another.
In the Ethereum blockchain, transactions can support any kind of logic. They have the expressive
power of a Turing-Complete machine - meaning they can be steps for a task that a computer can do.

As a piece of code that sits on the blockchain, a smart contract can automate tasks.
When an account receives money it can automatically distribute it to others.
This is entirely transparent so all the nodes(miners) can see what logic is being executed.


## Oracles
Smart contracts exist in the blockchain network and is not able to access data outside, in which the oracle comes into play. In order for the smart contract to proceed, there must be a "thing" that gives a true or flase value for the smart contract to proceed. The oracle serves as that agent that find and verifies information for the smart contract to check for the conditions in a secure manner.


## Blockchain Technologies

Two of the most common technologies used are :
- Ethereum
- Hyperledger
