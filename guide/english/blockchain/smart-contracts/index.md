## Smart Contracts

Transactions in a blockchain are a very basic contract - One party sends resources to another.
In the Ethereum blockchain, transactions can support any kind of logic. They have the expressive
power of a Turing-Complete machine - meaning they can be steps for a task that a computer can do.

As a piece of code that sits on the blockchain, a smart contract can automate tasks.
When an account receives money it can automatically distribute it to others.
This is entirely transparent so all the nodes(miners) can see what logic is being executed.

Smart contracts can be used to create Decentralized Apps or Dapps that live on a host blockchain.
The most famous Dapp is perhaps the game CryptoKitties which exploded in popularity towards the end of 2017. 
The network that CryptoKitties lives on, Ethereum, faced heavy congestion as a result. 


## Blockchain Technologies

Two of the most common technologies used are :
- Ethereum: generally made with Solidity
- Hyperledger: generally made with Go, or Java
