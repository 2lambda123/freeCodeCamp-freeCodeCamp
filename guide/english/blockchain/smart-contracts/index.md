## Smart Contracts

Cryptocurrency transactions that occur on a blockchain are an example of a very basic contract: one party sends money to another. However, blockchains also have the potential to manage and execute more complicated contracts. On the Ethereum blockchain, for example, one can utilize _smart contracts_ â€” blocks of code that only execute when their conditions are met. Smart contracts are Turing-Complete and as decentralized as the monetary transactions that occur on the blockchain. The combination of decentralized programs and money make for interesting possibilities.

As a piece of code that sits on the blockchain, a smart contract can automate tasks in a decentralized and transparent manner. Examples of this include managing the process of recieving and distributing micro-payments for viewing ads (such as with the Basic Attention Token) and managing buy/sell order books for exchanges transparently (such as with the 0x project).
