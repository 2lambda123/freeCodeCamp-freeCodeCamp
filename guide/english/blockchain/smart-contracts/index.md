## Smart Contracts

Transactions in a blockchain are a very basic contract - One party sends resources to another.
In the Ethereum blockchain, transactions can support any kind of logic. They have the expressive 
power of a Turing-Complete machine - meaning they can be steps for a task that a computer can do.

As a piece of code that sits on the blockchain, a smart contract can automate tasks.
When an account receives money it can automatically distribute it to others.
This is entirely transparent so all the nodes(miners) can see what logic is being executed.

### Smart Contracts in Ethereum

Smart contracts in ethereum are written using Solidity, its a high-level, contract-oriented programmng language, and targets Ethereum Virtual Machine, one can use Remix online IDE to try writting and deploying smart contracts

### Smart Contracts in Hyperledger

Smart contracts in Hyperledger is called chaincode, and is written in Golang programming language.


## Blockchain Technologies

Two of the most common technologies used are :
- Ethereum
- Hyperledger
