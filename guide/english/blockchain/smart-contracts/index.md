## Smart Contracts

First of all you need to understand the that the term smart contract is just a piece of code.There is nothing smartness in it nor it is a contract.We all know in blockchain technology the participants need not to be aware of each other i.e they need not to know one another so we implement a piece of code which could ensure there is no fraud or tempering in transactions.

Smart contract(which is a computer code) is stored and replicated on the system and supervised by the network of computers that run the blockchain.Blockchain basically removes the use of **middleman** so smart contracts help you exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman. 

As Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, explained smart contract approach as "an asset or currency is transferred into a program and the program runs this code and at some point it automatically validates a condition and it automatically determines whether the asset should go to one person or back to the other person, or whether it should be immediately refunded to the person who sent it or some combination thereof.In the meantime, the decentralized ledger also stores and replicates the document which gives it a certain security and immutability."

## Understand Smart Contract with the Analogy of Stone ##

The basic features of smart contract which are Permanance,Transparent or tamper proof ,Neutral all of which combined gives birth to the **trust** in trustless system.Lets understand each feature with the help of stone.

1.Permanance - Once you carve something on the stone(as done in ancient time) it can't be changed.It's physically permanent.So should be the smart contract codes i.e. once implemented ,it should not bt changed.

2.Transparent -This is very importantt feature of smart contract which could be undertood with the help of stone carving.Once you carve omething on the it is visible to everyone and if you try to erase something it would be clearly visible.This makes it tamper proof as well.

3.Neutral -These rules apply equally to all. Stone is neutral. It obeys the laws of physics, not men. It doesn’t care if you’re a powerful king or a peasant — it behaves exactly the same for everyone.


The stone analogy was taken from [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/smart-contracts-for-dummies-a1ba1e0b9575) (If you are reading this document then you must read this article to understand smart contracts in easy way)
