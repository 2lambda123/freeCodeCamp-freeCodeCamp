## Smart Contracts

Transactions in a blockchain are a very basic contract - One party sends resources to another.
In the Ethereum blockchain, transactions can support any kind of logic. They have the expressive
power of a Turing-Complete machine - meaning they can be steps for a task that a computer can do.

As a piece of code that sits on the blockchain, a smart contract can automate tasks.
When an account receives money it can automatically distribute it to others.
This is entirely transparent so all the nodes(miners) can see what logic is being executed.


## Blockchain Technologies

Two of the most common technologies used are :
- Ethereum
- Hyperledger

## Solidity Smart Contract Programming

Solidity is a contract-oriented programming language specifically created for developing smart contracts on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). Solidity enables developers to create apps that implement self-enforcing business logic embodied in smart contracts. 

Solidity is the primary language on Ethereum and is also used on some private blockchains that run on the Ethereum platform such as Monax's Hyperledger Burrow blockchain.
