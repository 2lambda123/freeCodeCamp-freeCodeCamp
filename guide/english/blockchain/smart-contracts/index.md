## Smart Contracts

The idea of a smart contract was first proposed in 1994 by Nick Szabo, as a computerized transaction 
protocol that can automatically execute the terms of a contract. His primary motivation was to 
design a system that could satisfy the agreed contractual conditions of multiple parties without the need
for a trusted intermediary. While the technology at the time could not support this functionality, Nick 
theorized that smart contracts would have a profound impact on economics and law by minimizing the need
for trust, while lowering costs associated with relying on middlemen and the risks of malicious or 
incompetent actors. 

Fast-forward a couple decades and now we can see that the emergence of blockchain technology has enabled the 
application of smart contract technologies on a global scale. On the Ethereum blockchain, the first 
cryptocurrency outfitted with a Turing-complete coding language, anyone can define the logic of a contract 
as code and deploy it to the entire network where it is validated and stored in an immutable database--all
without the need for a centralized authority. On Ethereum's blockchain, contracts can be viewed as machine 
actors who can send and recieve money based on a predefined logic, and once they are deployed cannot be 
tampered with or interrupted. 

The application of smart contract technologies is wide-ranging and extends to many industries like finance,
law, healthcare, real estate, supply chain, and more. Smart contracts enable a secure and trustless way to 
automate any number of contractual agreements which ultimately reduces costs, increases efficiency, and 
provides autonomy to users.
