## Smart Contracts

Transactions in a blockchain are a very basic contract - One party sends resources to another.
In the Ethereum blockchain, transactions can support any kind of logic. They have the expressive 
power of a Turing-Complete machine - meaning they can be steps for a task that a computer can do.

As a piece of code that sits on the blockchain, a smart contract can automate tasks.
When an account receives money it can automatically distribute it to others.
This is entirely transparent so all the nodes(miners) can see what logic is being executed.


## Blockchain Technologies

Two of the most common technologies used are :
- Ethereum
- Hyperledger

## Ethereum
It can be a confusing word currency as technology but actualy ethereum is more then a cryptocurrency it a platform which runs on 
blockchain which provide platform for other application to use as this service for various pupose like decentralized application.
It has a unique capability to run code, store code/Data on blockchain which enable them to not only transact money but also a piece of service with it. This is how the Smart contracts came into picture after bitcoin. Now Smart Contracts can e used to automate task transparently which make them extremly trust worthy application for user in this modern world.
