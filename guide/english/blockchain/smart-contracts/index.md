## Smart Contracts

As a piece of code that sits on the blockchain, a smart contract can automate tasks, such as financial transactions or managing an individuals digital identity. 

For example, transactions made on the blockchain constitute a very basic contract - one party sends resources and another party recieves them. Smart contracts facilitate such transactions by defining the terms of the trade and the values of the currencies involved. In the Ethereum blockchain, transactions can support any kind of logic. They have the expressive power of a Turing-Complete machine - meaning they can execute steps for a task that a computer could do.

When an account receives money it can automatically distribute it to others via a smart contract. This is entirely transparent so all the nodes (miners) can see what logic is being executed.


## Blockchain Technologies

Two of the most common technologies used are :
