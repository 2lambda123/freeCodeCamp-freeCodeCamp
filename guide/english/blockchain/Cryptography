Crytopgraphy is the art of creating (encryption) or solving (decryption) codes. It relies on mathematics and logic principles to derive the codes.

Blockchains rely on crytopgraphy for the following purposes:
* To ensure a verified transaction is stored securely into a block 
* A new block is appended to the blockchain securely
* To prevent blocks previously created from being changed or altered

An example of a type of cryptographic algorithm is SHA (Shared Hash Algorithm) 256. The Bitcoin blockchain relies on the SHA256 hashing algorithm to secure its transactions.
