## GraphQL

Developed by Facebook and launched in 2015, GraphQL is an API standard defined by its use of a declarative request that returns only the data the client requested, in the shape they desire. An alternative to the fixed endpoints of REST, its flexible approach makes aggregating data from multiple sources simpler, analytics are more refined and minimising the data fetched puts less pressure on slower networks, which speeds up responses for users.
