## Blue screen of death (BSOD)

Blue screen of death (BSoD) is a Microsoft Windows operating system error screen that is displayed to indicate system conflicts and the potential for a crash. This term gets its name because these critical messages were displayed on a blue screen.
### Ways to deal BSOD
Usually, you will be given a symptom, a cause, and a user action. Ensure the symptom and cause match your scenario; sometimes there will be multiple pages for the same error code due to multiple causes such as bad RAM (random access memory,) or a program causing the stop error.

Simply follow the user action listed to complete the repair. The fixes are fairly straightforward and well written, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding out exactly what you need to do to get your computer back in working condition.
