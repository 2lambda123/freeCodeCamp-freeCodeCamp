## Read Only Memory

Read-only Memory (ROM) is a self descriptive type of memory that references the idea that a computer and its appliations can only read data from it. This is in direct contrast to other memory types, where it is possibe to read and write data and store it in memory.

### Examples of ROM 

#### BIOS ROM
In the early days of modern computers, one of the most common ROM chips used was the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) ROM.  The chip would hold specific instructions that a computer needed in order to start up and it was critical that the information could not be accidentally modified. Once the BIOS ROM chip was installed (generally soldered to the motherboard), it could not be modified. Fast forward to the 2000's and BIOS technology had improved to where a BIOS could now use EPROM (An erasable type of ROM) where the instructions could be updated in a controlled fashion by the manufacturer, but the operation of the chip would still have the same behavior in being read-only. The act of "updating the BIOS" for a computer is infact updating the programmaing of the EPROM Bios.

#### CD-ROM
The CD-ROM is a type of compact disc storage object that requires the use of an optical laser to read the data off the disc. The devices used to read the data house the lasers and are called CD-ROM Drives. The disc itself is generally created in a factory and once made, is read only. This is in contrast to the CD-R (compact disc recordables) medium which has the additional ability to hold new data.

### Programmable ROM (PROM)
PROM or Programmable ROM (Programmable Read Only Memory) is a computer memory chip that can be programmed once after it has been created. Once the PROM has been programmed, the information written is permanent and cannot be erased or deleted. PROM was first developed by Wen Tsing Chow in 1956 and a good example of a PROM is a computer BIOS in early computers. 

#### EPROM
Short for Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory, EPROM is a non-volatile memory chip that was invented by Dov Frohman in 1971 while at Intel that can only be read. If exposed to ultraviolet light an EPROM can be reprogrammed if needed, but otherwise does not accept or save any new data. Hardware manufactures use EPROM when it may be needed that the data contained on the EPROM needs to be changed. An EPROM chip is distinguishable by a small quartz crystal (not glass) circle window that exposes the chip so that can be reprogrammed. In the picture shown on this page is an example of an Intel 8048 made by NEC and is an example of an EPROM chip.

Today, EPROM chips are not used in computers and have been replaced by EEPROM chips.

#### EEPROM
Short for Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory, EEPROM is a PROM that can be erased and reprogrammed using an electrical charge. EEPROM was developed by George Perlegos while at Intel in 1978 and unlike most memory inside a computer, this memory remembers data when the power is turned off.
EEPROM was a replacement for PROM and EPROM chips and is used for later computer's BIOS that were built after 1994. Having a computer with an EEPROM allows a computer user to update the BIOS in their computer without having to open the computer or remove any chips.
