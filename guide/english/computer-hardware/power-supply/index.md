## Power Supply

A Power Supply Unit (PSU) supplies power to a computer. It converts AC power into steady low-voltage DC power for the internal components. 


A PSU is usually not user serviceable. For your safety, it is wise to never open a power supply unit. If you do encounter an open power supply do not touch any of the internals even if it has been unplugged as power can be stored in the for a long time.
