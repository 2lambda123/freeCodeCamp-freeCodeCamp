## Power Supply

A Power Supply Unit (PSU) supplies power to a computer. It converts AC power into steady low-voltage DC power for the internal components. 

PSUs can be divided into 2

### Non-modular

A non-modular PSU is the most common type of PSU, this PSU is unadaptable with the power ports it provides to the components, it will usually contain:
* A 32pin power supply module for the motherboard
* Any number of SATA power supply modules, these are usually to power hard drives and disk drives
* One or two PCIE power supply modules, usually for expansion cards such as GPU
* A CPU power supply module

## Modular

Modular power supplies are becoming more common nowadays, these are more commonly seen amongst "high end" PSUs. The advantage these have over non-modular supplies is that they can be expanded to add additional power supply modules.

As with the non-modular supply, you will get:
* A 32 pin power supply module for the motherboard
* a CPU power supply module, this will usually be on the same cable as the motherboard power

The PSU will then have several expansion slots on the back to add additional PCIE power cables and SATA cables for multi GPU or hard drive builds. 



A PSU is usually not user serviceable. For your safety, it is wise to never open a power supply unit.

Note: Please do not "cheap out" when buying a power supply, it is one of the most crucial elements when building a PC and can damage your other components if not treated as such.
