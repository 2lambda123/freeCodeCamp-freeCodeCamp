## Power Supply

A Power Supply Unit (PSU) supplies power to a computer. It converts AC power into steady low-voltage DC power for the internal components. Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.

A power supply rail or voltage rail refers to a single voltage provided by a power supply unit (PSU). Computer power supplies may have short circuit protection, overpower (overload) protection, over-voltage protection, under-voltage protection, over-current protection, and over-temperature protection. 


A PSU is usually not user serviceable. For your safety, it is wise to never open a power supply unit.
