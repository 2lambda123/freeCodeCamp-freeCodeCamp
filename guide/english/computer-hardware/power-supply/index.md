## Power Supply

A Power Supply Unit (PSU) supplies power to a computer. It converts AC power into steady low-voltage DC power for the internal components. Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.

A power supply rail or voltage rail refers to a single voltage provided by a power supply unit (PSU). Computer power supplies may have short circuit protection, overpower (overload) protection, over-voltage protection, under-voltage protection, over-current protection, and over-temperature protection.

Like the CPU, or RAM, the PSU is a necessary component to the PC because without it nothing within the machine would function. Arguably may be one of the more crucial parts to research when assembling custom computers because of this fact. 

## Description

Is typically seen as a metal box either in the top or bottom, most posterior portion of a PC case. It has a bunch of cables streaming out of it to various parts of the computer. These cables can be detachable or integrated depending on the model of PSU. Typically it's wattage (e.g 600w) is relative to the size of the PSU, and is an important factor to keep in mind when considering the demand of your machine vs how much space is inside the case. 

## Standard types of Cables

With every modern power supply you should have:
- 1x Large cable for motherboard
- 1x Small cable for motherboard, typically powers the CPU
- 1x Small cable to power the GPU
- 2x or more small cables to power hard drives, optical drives, and accessory parts. 

## MISC Information

Because the power supply unit is the first component between the electric outlet and your other PC parts, they are at the highest risk of damage from power surges or spikes. If your machine is situated in an area where these things are common, it would be wise to invest in a surge protector or similar piece of hardware to prevent that kind of damage. 
Additionally, the internal parts of a PSU are usually not user serviceable. For your safety, it is wise to never open a power supply unit without proper equipment and/or certifications.
