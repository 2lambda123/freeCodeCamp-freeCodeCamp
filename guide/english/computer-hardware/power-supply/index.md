## Power Supply

A Power Supply Unit (PSU) supplies power to a computer. It converts AC power into steady low-voltage DC power for the internal components. 


A PSU is usually not user serviceable. For your safety, it is wise to never open a power supply unit.

Tip: When purchasing a PSU make sure to it is of enough wattage that is needed by the components (motherboard. GPU etc) in your computer. Same thing when purchasing upgrade parts for your pc, make sure your psu can support the part you are about to upgrade.
