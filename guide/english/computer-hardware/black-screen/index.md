## Black screen on Windows
A black screen or blank screen is a general description of a problem with a computer monitor where it displays nothing or doesn't power on when the power button is pressed. There are several causes to this type of issue. See the links below for troubleshooting steps.
### Fix black screen on Windows
Method 1: Restart the explorer.exe process

You may get the black screen issue because the explorer.exe process on your computer has been closed (possibly by a virus). It is a process that manages the desktop, taskbar, etc, on your operating system. Closing it can make your desktop and taskbar invisible, and you get the black screen issue.

To fix this issue, you can check and restart the process manually. To do so:

1) Press the Ctrl, Shift and Esc key on your keyboard at the same time. This will open Task Manager.

2) Click the Details tab (or the Processes tab in Windows 7’s Task Manager) and see if there exists a process called “explorer.exe“

If there is, try ending the process (right-clicking it and selecting End task or End process) and then reboot your computer. Then check to see if this fixes your problem.

Method 2: Enter safe mode and undo recent changes

You may have change some settings or installed a program on your computer, which are incompatible with your operating system. And it causes the black screen problem of your laptop.

You can try going into safe mode of your system and undo these changes. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode of your operating system. You can use it to troubleshoot issues on your computer. The method of entering safe mode varies depending on the Windows version you are using. You can check this guide to learn how to do this.

When you are in safe mode, undo the recent changes you have made to the system settings. Or uninstall the program you have recently installed on your program. If you have updated your system right before you got the black screen issue, uninstalled these updates and contact Microsoft for advice. If you are not clear what you have changed, it is recommended that you use System Restore feature to revert your computer’s state.

Method 3: Hard reset your laptop

Hard resetting your laptop can clear all the information in your memory and the charges in your laptop. This is helpful for restoring your laptop screen. To hard reset your laptop:

1) Turn off your laptop.

2) Disconnect all the peripheral devices on your laptop.

3) Remove the battery. (If it is not removable, skip this step.)

4) Disconnect the power cable from your laptop.

5) Press and hold the power button on your laptop for about one minute.

6) Connect the power cable to your laptop and turn it on.

7) Turn off your laptop.

8) Connect the battery to your laptop and turn it on.

9) If this method works for you, you will see there starts to be something showing up on your laptop screen.

Note that this method may not be able to hard reset laptops of all makes. You can consult the official guides for your laptop for the proper way of hard resetting your device.

Method 4: Reinstall your memory

It is also possible that your laptop screen issue comes from your laptop memory (RAM).
