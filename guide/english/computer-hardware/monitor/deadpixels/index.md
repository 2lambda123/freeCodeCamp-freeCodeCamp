## Dead Pixels on Monitors

A dead pixel is a picture element in which all three RGB (red, green, blue) sub-pixels are permanently turned off, which creates a black spot in the display.

Malfunctioning transistors and manufacturing flaws can result in dead pixels. Dead pixels are often confused with stuck pixels, which have a different cause and effect. Each pixel in a display is made up of three sub-pixels: one red, one green and one blue. In a stuck pixel, one or more of the three remains turned on so that the pixel displays consistently as a particular color rather than refreshing along with other display content.
### Fix dead pixels
Turn off your computer.
Get yourself a damp cloth, so that you don't scratch your screen.
Apply pressure to the area where the dead pixel is. Do not put pressure anywhere else, as this may make more dead pixels.
While applying pressure, turn on your computer and screen.
Remove pressure and the dead pixel should be gone. This works as the liquid in the liquid crystal has not spread into each little pixel. This liquid is used with the backlight on your monitor, allowing different amounts of light through which give off different colours.
