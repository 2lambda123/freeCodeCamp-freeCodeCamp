## Bootstrap Jumbotron and Page Header
Creating a Jumbotron
A jumbotron indicates a big box for calling extra attention to some special content or information.

A jumbotron is displayed as a grey box with rounded corners. It also enlarges the font sizes of the text inside it.

Tip: Inside a jumbotron you can put nearly any valid HTML, including other Bootstrap elements/classes.
#### Jumbotron Inside Container
Place the jumbotron inside the <div class="container"> if you want the jumbotron to NOT extend to the edge of the screen:

Example:
```
<div class="container">
  <div class="jumbotron">
    <h1>Bootstrap Tutorial</h1> 
    <p>Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing
    responsive, mobile-first projects on the web.</p> 
  </div>
  <p>This is some text.</p> 
  <p>This is another text.</p> 
</div>
```
