## Alerts

The Bootstrap framework provides you with various styling options for alerts. These styles help you provide a visual representation to the user of what the alert may bring attention to.

#### How To Use:
To use bootstrap alerts you create a new div element with two classes: 1) an 'alert' class and an 'alert-_____' class'.  A code example has been provided below.

**Code Example:**

`<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  A simple primary alertâ€”check it out!
</div>`
