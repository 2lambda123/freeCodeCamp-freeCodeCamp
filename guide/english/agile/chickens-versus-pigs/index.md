## Chickens Versus Pigs

"Chickens versus Pigs" refers to a story about a chicken and a pig, where the chicken proposes they open a restaurant called "Ham-n-Eggs".
The pig refuses, because while the chicken just needs to lay eggs, the pig has more ("their bacon") at stake.

In an Agile software development project, the software developer is the pig. If they fail to complete the job, or fail to do it well,
they have a lot at stake. This could be their reputation, or maybe even their position. Other team members might also be considered pigs, 
depending on how much they have at stake. 

On the other hand, many team members are chickens. For example, the client or a high-level project manager would not really be impacted
by the failure of the project. They are interested in its success, and might make contributions, but have lower stakes and thus
have significantly less commitment to the project. 

A common situation to refer to this metaphor is when talking about the daily scrum meeting. Pigs are encouraged to contribute to the meeting because they need to collaborate in order to achieve the common goal and will be held accountable in case it's not reached. Stakeholders however are asked to be silent if they happen to attend the meeting. 

Another classic situation is when talking about estimations. Estimations must only be provided by the the developers who actually perform the work and will be held accountable if the estimations are not correct.  

Every developer in a team should strive to be a pig rather than a chicken. Teams can benefit from (but should not rely on) the chickens in order to minimize risk and
guarantee the project is delivered as efficiently as possible.
