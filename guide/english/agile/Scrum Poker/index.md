## Planning Poker

Planning poker or Scrum Poker is a team based, gamified technique for estimating complexity or effort. 

Usually done during sprint planning, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards(Poker cards with values like 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100) face-down to the table.
The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias 
of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.
