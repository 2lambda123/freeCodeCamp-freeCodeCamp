Rational Software Corporation, which is a divison of IBM since 2003, created an iterative software development process framework and that came to be known as Rational Unified Process. This framework is based on a set of building blocks and content elements that describe how specific development goals are to be achieved.

The main building blocks are as follows-

1) Roles - It defines set of responsibilities, competencies and related skills. 
2) Work Products - The products that were developed throughout the working process comes under this category.
3) Tasks - A work that is assigned to a Role which results in a meaningful output comes under Tasks.

Rational Unified Process is an adaptable process framework and not a single concrete prescriptive process. It can be viewed as a specific implementation of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process"> Unified process </a>.
