## Pair Programming

Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "driver", the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the "navigator"; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so (<a href='https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>source</a>)

Extreme Programming (XP) recommends that all production code be written by two programmers working at the same time at the same computer, taking turns on the keyboard. Several academic studies have demonstrated that pair programming results in fewer bugs and more maintainable software. Pair programming can also help spread knowledge within the team, contributing to a larger <a href='http://deviq.com/bus-factor/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Bus Factor</a> and helping to promote <a href='http://deviq.com/collective-code-ownership/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Collective Code Ownership</a>.
