## Pair Programming

Extreme Programming (XP) recommends that all production code be written by two programmers working at the same time at the same computer, taking turns on the keyboard. Several academic studies have demonstrated that pair programming results in fewer bugs and more maintainable software. Pair programming can also help spread knowledge within the team, contributing to a larger <a href='http://deviq.com/bus-factor/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Bus Factor</a> and helping to promote <a href='http://deviq.com/collective-code-ownership/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Collective Code Ownership</a>.

One of the many reasons teams are skeptical about pair programming is that the teams will get upto 40% slower and write upto 20% less code. In reality the idea is that the team writes even lesser code. Pai programming makes sure that only the right code and required code is put it. This directly helps reduce the technical debt.
