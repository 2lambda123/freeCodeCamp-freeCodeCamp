## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are a set of statements that represent the Acceptance of User Story, Epic, or Feature to its users. Each User Story, as an item in the backlog, is a placeholder for a conversation. In this conversation,
the Product Owner which represents the users and the Delivery Team reach an understanding on the desired outcome for the item.

The Acceptance Criteria tells the Delivery Team how the code should behave and what needs to be present in order for the time to be considere completed or done. Avoid writing the **"How"** of the User Story; keep to the **"What"**. Basically, the business requirement over the technical implementation.
If the team is following Test Driven Development (TDD), it may provide a framework for some automated functional checks. Acceptance Criteria may also provide a rough guideline for what should be tested either by members of the team acting in a testing role or by a testing team.

Generally, if the story does not meet each of the Acceptance Criteria, then the Product Owner will not accept the story at the end of an iteration.

Conversely, the Acceptance Criteria can be viewed as an instrument to protect the Delivery Team during an iteration. When the Delivery Team commits to a fixed set of stories in Iteration planning they commit to the acceptance criteria for the story as well. This helps to avoid scope creep. 

Consider the following situation: when accepting the user story the Product Owner suggests adding something that was not in the scope of the User story and would require additional effort and work. In this case the Delivery team is in the position to politely reject this request (however small it might be) and ask the Product owner to create a new User story that can be taken care of in another iteration.
