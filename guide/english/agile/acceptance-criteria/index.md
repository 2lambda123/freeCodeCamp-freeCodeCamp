## Acceptance Criteria

The User Story is an item in your backlog that is a placeholder for a conversation. In this conversation,
the Product Owner and the Delivery Team reach an understanding on the desired outcome.

The Acceptance Criteria tells the Delivery Team how the product is expected to behave. The Acceptance Criteria answers the question for the Delivery Team, "How will we know when it's done?"
If the team is following Test Driven Development (TDD), it may provide the framework for the automated tests.
The Acceptance Criteria may be the beginnings of the test plan for the QA team.

Most importantly, if the User Story does not meet each of the Acceptance Criteria, then the Product Owner should not accept the User Story as delivered at the end of the iteration.

Acceptance Criteria can be viewed as an instrument to protect the Delivery Team. When the Delivery Team forecasts which User Stories the will focus on delivering in Sprint planning, they need to understand the Acceptance Criteria for those User Stories as well. This helps to avoid scope creep.

Consider the following situation: when accepting the User Story, the Product Owner suggests adding something that was not in the original scope of that User Story. In this case, the Delivery Team is in the position to reject this request (however small it might be), and ask the Product Owner to create a new User Story that can be considered for a future Sprint.
