## Daily Stand-Up and Daily Scrum

The Daily Stand-Up (DSU) or Daily Scrum meeting is one of the integral parts of scrum methodology.

As the name suggests, you hold the meeting daily, at the same time and, for a co-located team, in the same location. The meeting should be brief, finished in less than 15 minutes.

Only members of the Development team are required to attend the Daily Stand-up. Typically, the Scrum Master and Product Owners will also attend, but they are not required.

The standard agenda for each person is:
* What have you done since the last DSU
* What are you doing after this DSU
* What are the major obstacles that are stopping your progress, and where do you need help

Team members are to listen carefully to each other's contributions and attempt to identify areas where they can assist each other's progress. The standup meeting will also surface more lengthy topics of discussion that need to take place between different members of the team. These lengthier discussions that arise should then be halted and taken outside of the standup, involving only the relevant participants, and not the entire team. 

### The WHY behind Daily Stand-Pp
The Daily Stand-up upholds the Scrum values - Commitment and focus. The Daily Stand-Up meeting is not a status meeting, rather its a daily planning meeting where the team self-oraganize for the day's work ahead.

When done the right way the Daily Stand-Up helps team achieve:
* **Peer Pressure** - Healthy Agile teams experience and are comfortable with peer pressure. The work is inter-dependant and accountable to one another. Somebody's undone work becomes someone else's impediment.

* **Fine-Grain Cordination** - Working in an inter-dependant team. Team members depend on each other and have dependencies. the Daily Stand-Up meeting allows the opportunity to fine tune this. A member working on task may realise something else needs her attention as unless she finishes the task the other member cannot move on. An Agile team accepts zero wwaiting time as waiting is waste.

* **Focus on the few** - Every day during Daily Stand-Up the team affiems which are the few highest priority tasks that receive their focus so that they can get to done expeditiously. This de-clutters the team and brings in focus. 

* **Daily Commitment** - Each team member makes a daily commitment to the team. This allows team members to understand what to expect from one another for the day

* **Raising Impediments** - Though impediments need not wait for the Daily Stand-Up it is a very good moment to be raised in Daily Stand-Up as it offers the opportunity for the team to collectively tackle it after the stand-Up.
