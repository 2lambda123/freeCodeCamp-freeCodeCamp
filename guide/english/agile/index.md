## Agile

Agile software development is a collection of methodologies used to manage teams of developers. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. People and communication are considered more important than tools and processes.

Agile emphasizes asking end users what they want, and frequently showing them demos of the product as it is developed. This stands in contrast to the "Waterfall" approach, specification-driven development, and what Agile practitioners call "Big Up-Front Design." In these approaches, the features are planned out and budgeted before development starts. 

With Agile, the emphasis is on "agility" - being able to quickly respond to feedback from users and other changing circumstances.

The agile software development places its emphasis on four core values.
1. Preference on team and individual interactions over tools and processes.
2. A working software over exhaustive documentation.
3. Collaboration with customer is given more importance than contract negotiations.
4. Response to changes over following a plan.

There are many different flavors of agile, including Scrum and Extreme Programming.

## Benefits of Agile

# Benefits to Customer
High-value features are developed and delivered more quickly with short cycles.

# Benefits to Vendors
Vendors reduce wastage by focusing development effort on high-value features, and reduce time-to-market relative to waterfall processes due to decreased overhead and increased efficiency. Improved customer satisfaction translates to better customer retention and more positive customer references.

# Benefits to Development Teams
Team members enjoy development work, and like to see their work used and valued. Scrum benefits Team members by reducing non-productive work (e.g., writing specifications or other artifacts that no one uses), and giving them more time to do the work they enjoy. Team members also know their work is valued, because requirements are chosen to maximize value to customers.

# Benefits to Product Managers
Product Managers, who typically fill the Product Owner role, are responsible for making customers happy by ensuring that development work is aligned with customer needs. Scrum makes this alignment easier by providing frequent opportunities to re-prioritize work, to ensure maximum delivery of value.

# Benefits to Project Managers
Project Managers (and others) who fill the ScrumMaster role find that planning and tracking are easier and more concrete, compared to waterfall processes. The focus on task-level tracking, the use of Burndown Charts to display daily progress, and the Daily Scrum meetings, all together give the Project Manager tremendous awareness about the state of the project at all times. This awareness is key to monitoring the project, and to catching and addressing issues quickly.

# Benefits to PMOs and C-Level Executives
Scrum provides high visibility into the state of a development project, on a daily basis. External stakeholders, such as C-Level executives and personnel in the Project Management Office, can use this visibility to plan more affectively, and adjust their strategies based on more hard information and less speculation.
