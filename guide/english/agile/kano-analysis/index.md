Kano Model was put forth by Professor Noriaki Kano, professor of quality management at the Tokyo University of Science and a consultant in the field of quality management.

Kano Model is basically a theory for product development and customer satisfaction. This model classifies the customer preferences into 5 different categories. These are as follows-

1)**Must be Quality** - It covers all those features of a product that a customer expects and takes it as obvious that they will be present in the product of a particular type.

2)**One-dimensional Quality** - It covers all those features of a product that is responsible for making or breaking a deal for any organization i.e. those features which if provided will surely make a customer happy or else if not present can also lead to customer dissatisfaction.

3)**Attractive Quality** - It includes those features that are put in the product to attract a customer towards the product. If present, will lead to customer satisfaction and if not, it doesn't make any difference on customer's feeling i.e. they won't be dissatisfied.

4)**Indifferent Quality** - It includes those features that doesn't make any changes to customer's feeling i.e. they are not related to customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

5)**Reverse Quality** - It includes those features which if added can sometimes cause a reverse effect. For ex - If a feature phone has been given some complicated technical features then that can act as a reverse quality for it because a feature phone user prefers such a type of phone because of its simplicity to operate.


So, Kano Analysis is based on the Kano model and focuses on analyzing the requirements of the customer base being targeted based on the above categories.
