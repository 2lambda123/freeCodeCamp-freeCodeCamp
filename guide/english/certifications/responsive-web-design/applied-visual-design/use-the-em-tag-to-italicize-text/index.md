## Use the em Tag to Italicize Text

Just like the *u*, you can use *em* to italicize a set of text. *em* is very similar to *u* in the fact that you select a beginning and an end. 

*em* is very similar to *i* if you have seen programming before, the only difference (according to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em)) is that *em* represents stress emphasis of its contents, while *i* represents text is that set off from the normal prose.
