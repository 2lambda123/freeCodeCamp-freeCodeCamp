## Adjust the Tone of a Color

### Solution

```css
nav {
  background-color: hsl(180, 80%, 25%);
}
```

#### Explanation

* The `background-color: hsl(180, 80%, 25%);` declaration uses the same hue i.e. `180` as required by the challenge and sets the saturation and lightness at `80%` and `25%` respectively for all `nav` elements.
