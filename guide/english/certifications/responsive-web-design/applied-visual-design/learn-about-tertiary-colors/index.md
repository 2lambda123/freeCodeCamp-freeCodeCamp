## Learn about Tertiary Colors

Tertiary colours are combinations of primary and secondary colours. There are six tertiary colors; red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, blue-violet, and red-violet.

They are made by full sturation of a primary colour with half saturation of a secondary colour with no other colours.

### Solution

```css
.orange {
  background-color: #FF7D00;
}
  
.cyan {
  background-color: #00FFFF;
}
  
.raspberry {
  background-color: #FF007D;
}
```

#### Explanation:

* `background-color: #FF7D00;` sets the `background-color` property of all the elements having the class of `orange` to `#FF7D00`.
