## Add Borders Around Your Elements

To add a custom border around any HTML element, these three properties are used as shown below.

```CSS
.className {
    border-width: 10px;  /*sets the width/thickness of border to 10 pixels*/
    border-color: pink;  /*sets the color of the border to pink*/
    border-style: solid; /*sets the style of the border to solid line type*/
 }
```
The same className should be used as the value for class attribute of the HTML element which has to be styled.
Good Luck!
