<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

To make an image circular set it's border-radius property to 50%.
```css
.circular-image {
  border-radius: 50%;
 }
 ```
 The above code will make the elements with circular-image class circular in shape.
 The line `border-radius: 50%;` means that the border-radius property will be set to 50% of the width of the same element.
