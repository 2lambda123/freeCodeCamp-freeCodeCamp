## Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements

CSS selectors are widely used to apply styling to all instances of particular element.

### For Example

To apply color `purple` to all the H2 heading of the page, you can define the following CSS inside `<style></style>` block.

    h2 {
      color: purple;
    }

This will apply color `purple` to all H2 heading.

So if you are using `style="color: purple"` attribute on each H2 element, you can remove it.
Define it at single place inside `<style></style>` block.
