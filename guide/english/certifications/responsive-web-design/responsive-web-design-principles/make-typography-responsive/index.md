## Make Typography Responsive

Following the instructions:

Set the width of the h2 tag to 80% of the viewport's width and the width of the paragraph as 75% of the viewport's smaller dimension.

the solution is:

```css
  <style>
  ih2 {
    width: 80vw;
}

p {
    width: 75vmin;
}
  </style>
```
Now h2 is set to be 80% of the viewport's width and the paragraph's width is set to be 75% of the viewport's smaller dimension.
