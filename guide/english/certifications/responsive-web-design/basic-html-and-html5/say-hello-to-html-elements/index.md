## Say Hello to HTML Elements

## Problem
```html
<h1>Hello</h1>
```

## Objective
The objective is to change the text of the `<h1>` element into "Hello World".


Consider the following example:

`<p>This is a paragraph</p>` 

You can refer to as a __*'p element'*__; broke down to pieces you can find the following subelements:

subelement | description
----------- | ----------
`<p>` | This is the opening tag
`This is a paragraph` |  This is the element's text
`</p>` | This is the closing tag

Remember the challenge request: 
>Change your h1 element's text to say "Hello World" 

Good luck!

## Solution
Given that the `<h1>` element says "Hello", the problem has not been solved, as it does not say "Hello World", so we need to change the text "Hello" as shown below:

### Before Change
```html
<h1>Hello</h1>
```

### After Change
```html
<h1>Hello World</h1> <!-- The text has changed from "Hello" to "Hello World" through adding " World" into the <h1> element
```

## Full Solution
```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```
