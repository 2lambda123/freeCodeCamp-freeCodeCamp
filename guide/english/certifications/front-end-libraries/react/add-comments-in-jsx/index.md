![:triangular_flag_on_post:](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/triangular_flag_on_post.png?v=3 ":triangular_flag_on_post:") Remember to use <a>**`Read-Search-Ask`**</a> if you get stuck. Try to pair program ![:busts_in_silhouette:](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/busts_in_silhouette.png?v=3 ":busts_in_silhouette:") and write your own code ![:pencil:](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/pencil.png?v=3 ":pencil:")

## Add Comments in JSX
You can comment as you used to do with code blocks in Javascript `/* some JS code */` but they need to wrapped by curly braces to add comments in JSX:
For example:
* Single-line comment:
```jsx
{/*<h1>Hanoi University of Science</h1>*/}
```

* Multi-line comments:
```jsx
{/*
<h1>Hanoi University of Science</h1>
<p>Falculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Informatics</p>  
*/}
```

NOTE: You can't use HTML comment in JSX like this:
```html
<!-- not working -->
```
