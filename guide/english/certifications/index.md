## Certifications

### Overview

Each certificate curriculum should take approximately 300 hours to complete and includes 5 required projects, while other challenges are optional.

### The Full Stack Development Certificate

Upon completion of all six certificates, the freeCodeCamp [Full Stack Development Program Certificate](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/meta/free-code-camp-full-stack-development-certification/) will be issued. This final distinction signifies completion of approximately 1,800 hours of coding with exposure to a wide range of web development tools.

### Legacy Certifications

There are also Legacy Cirtifications which were deleted when they became outdated, but you can still find all the projects on freecodecamp, and the challenges can still be completed. If you were working on the ciriculum before it changed you can still complete them and earn your certificate.
