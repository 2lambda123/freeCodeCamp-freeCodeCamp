![:triangular_flag_on_post:](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/triangular_flag_on_post.png?v=3 ':triangular_flag_on_post:') Remember to use <a>**`Read-Search-Ask`**</a> if you get stuck. Try to pair program ![:busts_in_silhouette:](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/busts_in_silhouette.png?v=3 ':busts_in_silhouette:') and write your own code ![:pencil:](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/pencil.png?v=3 ':pencil:')

### ![:checkered_flag:](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/checkered_flag.png?v=3 ':checkered_flag:') Problem Explanation:

- You need to write a microservice that will return a JSON with the ipaddress, the preferred language, and the browser software. The JSON format is like the example output, "{"ipaddress":"159.20.14.100","language":"en-US,en;q=0.5",
"software":"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0"}".
- Everything will be provided in an HTTP request from a browser or other user agent (such as the Freecodecamp test which will grade your app) and your task is to read that data and provide it in the required JSON format.

- Note, the challenge requires a working solution deployed to the internet and a Github repo. You can copy your Glitch intance to your Github, instructions [here:](https://glitch.com/help/github/).

The IP address is accesible as req.ip.

## ![:speech_balloon:](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/speech_balloon.png?v=3 ':speech_balloon:') Hint: 2

The req object has an 'accept-language' and a 'user-agent' key, which will be helpful.

## ![:beginner:](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/beginner.png?v=3 ':beginner:') Basic Code Solution:

```javascript
app.get('/api/whoami/', (req, res) => {
  let responseObject = {
    ipaddress: req.ip,
    language: req.get('accept-language'),
    software: req.get('user-agent'),
  };

res.json(responseObject);
```

### Code Explanation:

- The IP adress is from req.ip.
- The required 'language' is from 'accept-language' and 'software' is from 'user-agent'. res.json automatically turns an object into a JSON for you.
- If you want shorter code, you can try replacing responseObject with the object assigned to it.

That's it. There is no intermediate or advanced solution yet. If you have a better, more elegant solution, help us all out and contribute them!
