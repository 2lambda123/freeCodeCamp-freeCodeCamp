#### Solution:
So were exactly do you run this *console.log()* command?
In order to see the difference between the live console (terminal of freecodecamp) and our browser we need to open up the console in our browser. 
Contemporary internet browser have a built in feature called Developer Tools which, among others contains a live console. 
In this console we can execute Javascript commands and see the result. It behaves in a same manner as the window we write code here in Freecodecamp!
