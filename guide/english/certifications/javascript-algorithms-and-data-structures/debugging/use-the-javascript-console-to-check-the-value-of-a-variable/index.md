## Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

In order to open up the Javascript Console of your Browser (chrome,firefox,safari,opera,edge) press: [here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/certifications/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging/understanding-the-differences-between-the-freecodecamp-and-browser-console)

## Hint 1:
In order to see what is for example the stored value of a variable, we can use the command `console.log()`.
The basic syntax of the `console.log()`command in order to display for example`VARIABLE_NAME` is: `console.log(VARIABLE_NAME)`
In this exercise it is required to use this command in order to display in our console the value of two variables so...
How may I log into my console the value of varible `a` and `sumAB`? 


## Solution:
```` javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Add your code below this line
console.log(a);

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);
````
