The upcoming section contains some basic algorithmic problems that are indicative of tasks that are commonly encountered by most programmers at some point. They should be relatively easy, but if you get stuck, you can always ask for help in the <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>FreeCodeCamp Forum</a>, or refer to the Guide using the "Get A Hint" button for some clues.
