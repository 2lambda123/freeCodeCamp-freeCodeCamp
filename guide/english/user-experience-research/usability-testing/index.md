Usability Testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users.
Typically, during a test, participants will try to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and take notes.
The goal is to identify and usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data and determine the participant's satisfaction.
