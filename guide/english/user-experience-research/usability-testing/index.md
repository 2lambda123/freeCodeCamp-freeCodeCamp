Usability Testing involves evaluating the ease with which a user or group of users can interact with a site, software application etc.


This is typically (although not exclusively) achieved by observing users as they attempt to complete a pre-determined set of tasks, with the aim of identifying any difficulties which may arise or any aspects that users particularly approve of; as well as generally noting any observations they might make. Data generated from testing can then be used to inform any subsequent design decisions. 

This is often an iterative process; undertaken at various stages of a product's development cycle with prototypes of varying levels of fidelity. Employing a low-fidelity prototype of a website, for example, such as a paper sketch that approximates what it will look like, can be considerably more efficient than fully developing an actual website only to discover that it must be changed again.
