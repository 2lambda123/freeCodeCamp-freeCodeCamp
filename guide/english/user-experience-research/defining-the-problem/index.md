## Defining the Problem
In defining the problem, we’re determining the root cause of what inhibits our users from completing the desired goals. It’s important to note that what a client or individual thinks the problem is and what the problem actually is, could be very different. Often, the client is too close to the issue or too fixated on another, unrelated issue. Research, at this phase, is critical to realizing the actual problem.
That is not to say, however, that the client should be ignored in the process. The client’s view of the problem should be considered and examined in a serious manner. However, it is just one viewpoint of the problem at hand.
