## Data Driven Design

**What is Data Driven Design?**

Data-driven design is a data-based, strategic design approch that aims to create web/app/software or any other digital product on the basis of available user-data gathered using a number of ways such as user interviews, analytics interpretation, surveys, research and so on.

The end goal of any data-driven design efforts is to create a user-centred digital experince by offering a product that caters to their needs.

**Why Data Driven Desing?**

One of the most important and most common reasons as to why we need to adopt data driven design approach is that designers who design products are not the end-users of that products. In other words, designers don’t design for themselves; they design for real users who are going to use that product and hence it is critical to know that those real users want out of the product. And one of the msot effective ways to find out this answer is to listen to the data that designers gather from potential users.

**How to Get Started with Data Driven Design?**

The first step to start with data driven design approach is to talk to existing or potential users. If you already have got a user-base, approach them, talk to them and identify their pain-points with your products. 

There are a few ways you can use to listen to existing users:

**1)	Understand Analytics**

In order to understand what your users are doing with your current product, analyze your analytics data (Google Analytics is a great tool to start with this). Understand where they are going on your website or app and where they get stuck. This will help you spot the faulty part on your app or website. You can also notice the browsing pattern from Google Analytics. This will tell you the typical flow your most visitors take to surf through your website while taking desired action.

**2)	Talk to real users**

Another useful method is what we call User Interviews– talking to your real users and finding out what troubles them and what they love about your product. You can do this by conducting formal or informal interview sessions with your customers. 

A general practice to condut user interview is to identify some of your users who’d agree to talk to you precisely. Once you have them for interview, ask them most common yet the most important questions such as what they like about your website, how they visit, what is their usual visiting pattern, how long their visit stay and what makes them leave it before completing their desired action.

Customers revealing real answers to these questions can be real gem for you. If you get to know the answers to them questions, you are half way through your data driven design.

**3)	A/B Test**

Another popular method is to conduct A/B Test on your website or app. An A/B test is simply a test of two different version of the same element (such as banner, call to action button, headline, price, color etc.) on your website.

An effective A/B test can tell you which version of your tested element is more popular among customers. 

For example: If you want to redesign your home-page using data driven design approach, you can conduct A/B test with two different design of the home-page and directing a few of users on 1st version of the design, while directing other users on the 2nd version and thus noticing which version retains or converts more users during a specific test duration. 

There are many free and premium tools available to conduct A/B testing. The most popular ones are:
