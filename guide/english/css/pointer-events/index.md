The ```pointer-events``` property determines if an element will react to pointer events.

There are 4 possible values that can be assigned to the ```pointer-events``` property:
```auto```	  Default Setting:  Reacts to ```pointer events``` like :hover or click. 
```none```	  Sets that the element won't react to ```pointer-events```
```initial```	Uses the default value
```inherit```	Inherits from parent
