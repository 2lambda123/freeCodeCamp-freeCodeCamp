# Use Flexbox for Responsive Pages

Flexbox let's us code pages that are responsive, without the hassle of floats and clears, in a flexible row and column format. It is not too hard to learn,  and is much more coder-friendly than hacking your way through a page design.

The beauty of flexbox is that containers dynamically _flex_ to grow and shrink according to a container's dimensions, and flexible space can be applied so that flex items have dynamic spacing. It can also automatically wrap flex items onto new rows or columns as the viewport shrinks, which is useful if you are unsure about media queries.

Flexbox can be applied to any container-like element, such as, but not limited to ```<div>```, ```<header>```, ```<footer>```, and even ```<form>```. Flex containers contain flex items whose layout on the screen is determined by the direction of the page flow (row or column). Flex items are typically visual elements, such as ```<p>```, ```<img>```, ```<h1> - <h6>```.

A very good visual guide into flexbox and its elements can be seen at [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
