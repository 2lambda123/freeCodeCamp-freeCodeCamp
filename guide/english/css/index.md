# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets*. It is a language used for describing the style of a document written in HTML. 
It was designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, which grately improved content accessibility, gave more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, and reduced complexity and repetition in the structural content. 
It was first invented in 1996, and is now a standard feature of all major web browsers.

CSS specifications are maintained by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/).

You can build some pretty amazing things in CSS alone, such as this pure-CSS [Minesweeper game](https://codepen.io/bali_balo/pen/BLJONk) (which uses no JavaScript).

## Suggested Reading:
A good start is the freeCodeCamp curriculum [Introduction to Basic CSS](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css).

Another suggestion for beginners is W3C's [Starting with HTML + CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/011/firstcss) teaches how to create a style sheet.

The site [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) is a great example how the same html can be styled to look totally unique.
