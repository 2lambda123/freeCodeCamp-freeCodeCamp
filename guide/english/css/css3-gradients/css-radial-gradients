## CSS Radial Gradients
A radial gradient is defined by its center.

To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.

Syntax:
```
background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);
```
By default, shape is ellipse, size is farthest-corner, and position is center.

Example Syntax:
```
#grad {
  background-image: radial-gradient(red, yellow, green);
}
```
