# Selecting Nth-of-type

CSS selectors allows us to select a tag which has multiple siblings within a parent. They may not have any other distinguishing properties. A common example is selecting li tags with ul.

### First child of type

Select the first li child of its parent with `li:first-of-type`

### Nth child of type

Select the third li child of its parent with `li:nth-of-type(3)`
