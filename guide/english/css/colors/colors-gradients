## CSS Colors
Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.
#### Color Gradients
CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

CSS defines two types of gradients:

Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
####CSS Linear Gradients
To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. 
You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

Syntax:
```
background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);
```
Example:
```
#grad {
    background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);
}
```
#### CSS Radial Gradients
A radial gradient is defined by its center.

To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.
Syntax:
```
background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);
```
By default, shape is ellipse, size is farthest-corner, and position is center.
Example:
```
#grad {
  background-image: radial-gradient(red, yellow, green);
}
```
