## Terraform

Terraform is an infrastructure as code software by HashiCorp. It allows users to define a datacenter
infrastructure in a high-level configuration language, from which it can create an execution plan to
build the infrastructure in a service provider such as OpenStack or in a service provider such as 
IBM Cloud (formerly Bluemix), AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform. Infrastructure is defined
in a HCL Terraform syntax or JSON format.

Terraform is becoming more popular among cloud service providers. Terraform is integrated into the Azure
cloud shell. Google has a project team working to create GCP specific modules to make starting up
resources much quicker. As popular as Terraform is becoming AWS CloudFormation and Terraform are not
compatible.
