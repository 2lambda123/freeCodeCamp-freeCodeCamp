# WordPress Developer Tools

WordPress can be used for much more than just blogging. From simple websites to full scale web applications, WordPress has become a stable base for many developers to use. Just like any other framework, there are tools available that make building custom themes, plugins and applications in WordPress easier.

## Command Line Tools

### WP-CLI

WP-CLI is the command-line interface for WordPress. You can update plugins, configure multisite installations and much more, without using a web browser. WP-CLI provides a command-line interface for many actions you might perform in the WordPress admin such as installing and activating plugins, as well as actions you cannot do from the WordPress admin, such as deleting transients or finding and replacing website urls or other content.

### WordMove

Wordmove is a gem that lets you automatically mirror local WordPress installations and DB data back and forth from your local development machine to the remote server. Wordmove supports multi-stage environments that will allow you to manage moving WordPress site files and databases between your local, staging and production environments.
