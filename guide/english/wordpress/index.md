# WordPress

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system based on PHP and MySQL. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. It is most associated with blogging but supports other types of web content including more traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries, and online stores.

WordPress powers over 30% of all websites and is by far the most used CMS on the planet. Backed up by a huge community, this open source platform powers a multi-billion dollar economy with themes/plugins and custom software.

Easy to use, Wordpress offers an easy solution for both web developers and non-web developers alike to create a site.

Just to a few advantages of WordPress:
* Users are able to manage their Wordpress webpage from any computer
* Has a blog built-in and ready to go whenever applicable. 
* Has plugins, which extend functionality to WordPress sites.

Whether its page transitions or a customized contact form, WordPress users are only a few clicks away from success and a beautiful website.

### From Blogging Platform to CMS

The power of WordPress becomes apparent in the use of 3 features: custom post types, custom taxonomies, and custom fields. Generating custom post types allows a website administrator or web developer to separate very specific content types from the rest of their website content. This can be helpful on websites with large page counts and numerous varying content sections.

For example: lets say you have a company website with a large number of products, numerous physical storefront locations, and a news/blog section. If all of that content was all crammed into the default posts or pages section of the website admin panel, navigating said sections could very quickly become an overwhelming mess.

In this instance, you could create a custom post type for products, a custom post type for locations, keep thing the default posts section exclusively for your news/blog content.
