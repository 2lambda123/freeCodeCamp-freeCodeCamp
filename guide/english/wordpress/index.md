# WordPress

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system based on PHP and MySQL. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. It is most associated with blogging but supports other types of web content including more traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries, and online stores.

WordPress powers over 30% of all websites and is by far the most used CMS on the planet. Backed up by a huge community, this open source platform powers a multi-billion dollar economy with themes/plugins and custom software.

Easy to use, Wordpress offers an easy solution for both web developers and non-web developers alike to create a site.

Just to a few advantages of WordPress:
* Users are able to manage their Wordpress webpage from any computer
* Has a blog built-in and ready to go whenever applicable. 
* Has plugins, which extend functionality to WordPress sites. 

Whether its page transitions or a customized contact form, WordPress users are only a few clicks away from success and a beautiful website.

# Why Wordpress but not other CMS?

Privacy. The private/public content setting lets you choose what and how much of the available information you want to share. You may want a private page for current clients only, and public sections for everyone who visits.

Drafts and Scheduling.  Time is the most expensive asset we all have; you can use the scheduling feature to create content well in advance and schedule it to post on whatever schedule you choose.

Categorizing and Tagging.  Adding custom categories and tags  will help you manage and archive your content and provide an improved browsing experience for website visitors.  Your topics can be grouped together so that users will always be able to find all the information they need with just one click.

Media.  Managing photos and videos has never been easier. Upload and embed multimedia content in a matter of seconds without any help from a graphics specialist.

Plugins and Widgets.  There currently are 10,221 (and counting) free plugins ready for downloading and implementing into your WordPress website.  SEO tools, affiliate marketing tools, contact forms, image galleries and many more are all at your fingertips.  Itâ€™s pretty amazing, you could discover a new plugin every day.
