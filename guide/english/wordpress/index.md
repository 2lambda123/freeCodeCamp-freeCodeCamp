# WordPress

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system based on PHP and MySQL. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. It is most associated with blogging but supports other types of web content including more traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries, and online stores.

WordPress powers over 30% of all websites and is by far the most used CMS on the planet. Backed up by a huge community, this open source platform powers a multi-billion dollar economy with themes/plugins and custom software.

Easy to use, Wordpress offers an easy solution for both web developers and non-web developers alike to create a site.

Just to a few advantages of WordPress:
* Users are able to manage their Wordpress webpage from any computer
* Has a blog built-in and ready to go whenever applicable. 
* Has plugins, which extend functionality to WordPress sites. 

Whether its page transitions or a customized contact form, WordPress users are only a few clicks away from success and a beautiful website.

#Get Started With Wordpress
This guide will cover how to setup a basic Wordpress website. If anything is
missing I will go back and add more content.

##Domain
So, you need a domain because you want people to be able to browse your website! Get it from one of the providers, just make sure they 
are reputable enough.

##Hosting
You will also need a place to make sure your website is alive and comfy.
I suggest you not to pick the same company as your domain and hosting
provider.

##Wordpress
You will need Wordpress software to "power" your website. You can get it from: https://http://wordpress.org/download/

##DNS
So, now it is time to link your domain and server. You should be able to browse
the FAQ of the domain provider or ask them to do it for you.
Your hosting provider will give you a nameserver and you can use that DNS
server address for your domain. Go to DNS Zone editor and make sure you
follow the exact steps your domain provider requries.

##Installing Wordpress
If you have cPanel, go on to Softaculous and select Wordpress. It will automatically install Wordpress for your domain name.
