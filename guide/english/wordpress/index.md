# WordPress

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system based on PHP and MySQL. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. It is most associated with blogging but supports other types of web content including more traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries, and online stores.

WordPress powers over 30% of all websites and is by far the most used CMS on the planet. Backed up by a huge community, this open source platform powers a multi-billion dollar economy with themes/plugins and custom software.

Easy to use, Wordpress offers an easy solution for both web developers and non-web developers alike to create a site.

Just to a few advantages of WordPress:
* Users are able to manage their Wordpress webpage from any computer
* Has a blog built-in and ready to go whenever applicable. 
* Has plugins, which extend functionality to WordPress sites. 

Whether its page transitions or a customized contact form, WordPress users are only a few clicks away from success and a beautiful website.

## Multi-user and multi-blogging

Prior to version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate database tables. WordPress Multisites (previously referred to as WordPress Multi-User, WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to exist within one installation but is able to be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard. WordPress MS adds eight new data tables for each blog.

As of the release of WordPress 3, WordPress MU has merged with WordPress
