grep - search a File for a pattern
You will appreciate the usefulness of this command when you have to search one or more files for pattern of characters.
The basic command line format for using grep is
                                $ grep (pattern file...)
        If pattern is in fact contained in the files specified on the grep command line, the line of 
        text containing that pattern is displayed on the standard output.
