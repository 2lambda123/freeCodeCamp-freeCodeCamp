## Bash command: rm

**Delete a File/Directory** ,for example `rm hello`.

There are few commonly used arguments:

- `r` , means to recursively delete all the folders inside a directory.
- `f` , means to forcefully delete anything folder or file.

### Wildcards

The `rm` command can be used in conjunction with an asterisk to delete multiple items matching a specific set of criteria. For example, you could use `rm test*` to remove all files in a directory starting with "test" regardless of whatever text follows that string. You can also use an asterisk by itself to purge all files in the current directory using `rm *`.
