## Bash command: rm

**Delete a File/Directory** ,for example `rm hello`.

You will be prompted with **'rm: remove regular file ‘hello’?'** and will need to respond **'y'** before the file can be deleted. Use this command with caution because 'rm' is a permanent action.

There are few commonly used arguments:

- `r` , means to recursively delete all the folders inside a directory.
- `f` , means to forcefully delete anything folder or file.
