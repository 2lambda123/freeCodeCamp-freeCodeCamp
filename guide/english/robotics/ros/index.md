## Robot Operating System (ROS)
As opposed to its name, ROS is actually not an Operating System. ROS is an open source collection of software packages and libraries useful in robotic software development. It also includes tools (for visualization, simulation, etc.) and commonly used algorithms for essential functionalities like navigation and planning.
