## Amazon S3

S3 is an object based storage based inside AWS. Files are stored in containers called 'Buckets'. 
Buckets can hold an unlimitemd amount of data. The odject size restriction is 5TB per item.

Buckets serve several purpoises. They organise data storage into seperate buckts, allowing for data to be stored in a relivent way.
Bucket names must be uniquie as they use DNS in the AWS namespace for referencing, which means they can be accessed from multiple regions in the ASW network.
