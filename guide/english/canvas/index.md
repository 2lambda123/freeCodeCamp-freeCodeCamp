## HTML5 Canvas

Canvas is a technology introduced in HTML5 which can be accessed by the `<canvas>` tag. It allows graphics to be drawn via Javascript, and is a powerful tool for interactivity on the web.
Javascript applies canvas context, which is an object with properties and methods that you can use to render graphics inside the canvas element.
