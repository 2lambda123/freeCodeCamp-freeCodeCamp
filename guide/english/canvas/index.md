## HTML5 Canvas

Canvas is a technology introduced in HTML5 which can be accessed by the `<canvas>` tag. It allows graphics to be drawn via Javascript, and is a powerful tool for interactivity on the web.

## Usage

Canvas is made up of a drawing surface with _height_ & _width_ attributes. Javascript is used to access this using a full set of functions similar to other 2D APIs which allows users to generate dynamic graphics. Several uses of canvas include animation, games, image composition, and building graphs.
