Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are a category of Neural Networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. ConvNets have been successful in identifying faces, objects and traffic signs apart from powering vision in robots and self driving cars. 

CNN architecture consists of convolutional and pooling layers. Convolutional layer apply convolutional operation on its inputs. Pooling layer combines outputs from several neurons (usually 2x2 or 4x4) at convolutional layer into one neuron using non-linear function like max-pooling or average pooling.
