## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, We have a **labelled** observed set of data or  observation. And tha basic meaning of supervised here is reffering to data set i.e we have a data with input attributes and output labels to train a model to maintain a typical function with proper gradients or weights to predict further required output.  And Supervised learning can be categorized in two types on the basis of its output whether it is continuos like-100,511515,48484 or discreet like- {0,1},{4,8,3,7} etc.

### Regression

Given data about houses  such as -no. of rooms,length of rooms,carpet area,distance fromsupermarket etc you can predict their market prices. Since price is a continuous variable, this is a regression problem. 
<br>In another example, Microsoft released a web app that predicts age based on picture. Again, as age is continuous rather than discrete or categorical, this is also a regression problem.  

### Classification
Classification is used where we have to categorize into classes or several choices instead of continuous values. Take example - As we have to judge whether a disease such as cancer is malignant or benign on the basis of size of tumor we will use classification algorithms to classify.
<br>more example- In a firm I fyou have to decide whether a customer account is compromised or not.

###  Discussion points:
  
- What is special about supervised learning?
- In what scenario would you use it in?
- What are some example models?
