A Markov decision process is a discrete time stochastic control process. It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.

It is a mathematical framework which works on action,state and reawrd system.

It can be used when you want your algorithm to learn with the passage of time and try to better its functionaities.

Some of the good examples might be:

Harvesting: how much members of a population have to be left for breeding.
Agriculture: how much to plant based on weather and soil state.
Water resources: keep the correct water level at reservoirs.
Inspection, maintenance and repair: when to replace/inspect based on age, condition, etc.
Purchase and production: how much to produce based on demand.
Queues: reduce waiting time.
