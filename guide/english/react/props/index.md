### What are the props?
Props (short for properties) are the data passed into the component. They are immutable (read-only).

In React props is short for properties. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to React Components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes.

The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

Pass custom data to your React component.
Trigger "state" changes (more on this later).
Use via this.props.reactProp inside component's render() method.
