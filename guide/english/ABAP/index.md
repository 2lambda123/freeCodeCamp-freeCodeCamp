## What is ABAP?

ABAP stands for Advanced Business Application Programming and is a programming language used by SAP developers.
SAP is an ERP system used by large companies. It's renenue could be compared to other tech giants like Microsoft and Apple.
SAP Software is written in ABAP bytecode (compiled) which later on is interpreted by the C++ code of the kernel.

* C++ for the ABAP kernel
* ABAP for the ABAP stack
* Java for the Java stack

SAP in recent years has introduced HANA database. It is recommended in-memory (RAM) database to run SAP applications on. It creates index and aggregates on the fly. This was previously not efficient with standard HDD based databases.
HANA is the in-house database powering many of SAPâ€™s products. It is written in C++ with Python tests, and the entire code base lives inside of a single git repository. Hundreds of developers from all around the world are developing on about 10 million lines of C++ code and 15 million lines of Python tests.
Since HANA is deployed on Linux exclusively, many developers are using Linux on their workstations as well. So far Windows is still supported as a development environment, but this will change in 2019, leaving Linux as the only choice. 

ABAP is a robust programming language that allows the user to use object oriented concepts, inheritance, persistency, field symbols, structures to put a user's code in any place of the SAP ERP or Business Warehouse system. This concept allows developers to put business logic inside, create reports, expose and manipulate data. 
ABAP IDE is either SAP GUI or Eclipse.

Official ABAP documentation can be found in the link: https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-US/index.htm
ABAP can be used both in application and also executed directly on the database itself using ABAP Managed Database Procedures. 
This allows the user not to bring the data to the application layer and apply the logic directly in the database itself.

* Coments and documentation are written in HTML, later on in the code it can be displayed onmouse hover and using predefined keyboard shortcuts.
