## Firefox Developer Tools
Firefox's Developer Tools provide rich features web developers can use to effectively monitor and analyze the CSS, Javascript and HTML on web pages. 

Features:
  * Inspector: Right clicking elements on a page let you view and edit the CSS and HTML working behind the scenes.
  * Console: Errors are usually displayed here. Using console.log() can also be a powerful debugging tool
  * Debugger: You can view the javascript running the page and add breakpoints if you want to watch the page run
  * Style Editor: Can view and edit CSS files used on the page
  * Network: Can monitor the requests and responses of a web page. Their status codes are very useful when debugging APIs.
  * Performance: Can record performance or memory on a page
    
### Firefox recently released a Firefox Developer Edition Browser
