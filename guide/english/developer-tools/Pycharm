I have found that best and easiest way to quickly write and test python was Pycharm.
If you are a student, you can even get a year of Pycharm for Free. 
It allows you to make many configurations, and is a great text editor. 
It does a really good job of detecting errors as well.
If you don't want to pay they also have a great Community Edition.
