The <div> attribute is a block-level attribute, meaning each time a <div> attribute is called, it displays the contents 
contained on a new line.  Other examples of block-level syntaxes are <p>, or the parapraph element, and the header elements <h1> through <h6>.  
Div's are often used to style and space out content on a page or break up elements.  
The syntax for div is as follows:

<div>
  insert code here
</div>
