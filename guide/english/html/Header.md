Header command

(A) What is it?

        the basic symbol for the header command is <hx>
        where x can range from an empty space to any integer in the range [1,6]. If you give it any other value out of these 7 values,
        it would automatically take up a default value and that is of h6.

        h1 is the largest font size and h6 being the lowest (decreases monotonously)

(B) how is it used?
        example:
                     <h1> This is a header text</h1>
                     
(C) Where all can it be used? 
        It can be used under the <title> or the <body>
        
(D) Does it support any attributes? 
        Yes, attributes like "font","color" etc. which can be found in the attributes file will help you out further with this.
