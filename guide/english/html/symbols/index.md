## Symbols

HTML symbol entities are characters that are not represented on a user's keyboards. Many mathematical, scientific, and currency symbols
are not present on a normal keyboard; therefore, to add such symbols to a page using HTML, the HTML entity name can be used.
It is important to note that these will not effect the html code themselves, and will always be interpreted as text. For example, if we wanted to type &lt;div&gt; as text on a webpage, we may need to use these symbol entities.

If no entity name exists, either the entity number or hexadecimal reference can be used.

Combining Diacritical Marks
A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.

Some diacritical marks, like grave (  ̀) and acute (  ́) are called accents.

Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter, and between two letters.

Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.
