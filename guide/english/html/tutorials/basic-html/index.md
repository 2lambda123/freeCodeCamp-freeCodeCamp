## Basic HTML

## Basic Page Structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Explanation:
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` is to tell the browser you want the page to be rendered using HTML5.

The `<head></head>` is were you want to put things that help the browser and search engines such as `<title></title>` and `<meta>`.

The `<body></body>` is were the tags that will display on the page are such as `<h1></h1>` or `<p></p>`.


## HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the ```<h1>``` to ```<h6>``` tags.
  
## Examples:

```
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
```
