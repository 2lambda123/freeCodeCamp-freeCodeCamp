Structure of a basic HTML file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
  </body>
</html>  
```
Description of the Basic HTML file:

The file starts with <!doctype html>. This part is called a declaration, which lets the filereader know which version of HTML running. In this case, it will automatically run HTML5.
The <html> lets the filereader know where does the HTML code start. It stops with </html> located at the end of a document.
In <head> there is metadata, like the title, author and keywords. None of the elements written here will be visible once the code gets read. It stops with </head>.
In <body> there is code that will produce visible results once the code gets read, like text, images and video. It stops with </body>.
