## Basic HTML

**Intro:**
A commonly held belief by non developers is that *HTML* is a programming language. It is actually a markup language that tells browsers how to display a page for a user. Used in conjunction with *CSS*, browsers are told exactly how a web page should look.

There are certain tags that every HTML document should contain. Those tags are: `<!doctype>` which tells browsers what type of document the file is, `<html>` tags which contain the HTML, `<head>` tags which contain title, meta information, file imports, etc., and the `<body>` tag which is what displays on the web page.

By using the above tags, every webpage starts with a basic HTML structure.

**Structure of a basic HTML file:**

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
  </body>
</html>  
```
