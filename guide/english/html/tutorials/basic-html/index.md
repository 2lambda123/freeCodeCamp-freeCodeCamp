## Basic HTML

The basic structure of HTML always starts with a document type declaration: ```<!DOCTYPE html>```

You will need to add the ```<html>``` tag after the document type and close it with a ```</html>``` tag. This will be your actual HTML document.

The first element you will insert in your HTML will be the ```<head>``` tag that will contain all metadata from the website such as it's title, styles, links and others. This element needs to be closed with a ```</head>``` tag.

The visible part of your HTML lies within the tag ```<body>``` which will be inside the ```<html>``` tag and will also need to be closed with a ```</body>``` tag.


Below you can see the structure of a basic HTML file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
  </body>
</html>  
```
