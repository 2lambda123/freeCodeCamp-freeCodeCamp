HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.

Structure of a basic HTML file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
  </body>
</html>  
```
