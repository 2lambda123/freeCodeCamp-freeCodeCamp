## Block and Inline Elements

Let us understand them using below examples :

#### Code Sample with Output : 
![Block Output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16048167/31070017-6f2cf0a2-a77c-11e7-9de6-110b9d0b488d.PNG)

#### Block-Level Element : 
A Block-level element occupies the entire space of the parent(container) such as `<div>` and `<p>` in the example .

Note that both `<div>` and `<p>` start from a new line each time, forming a **block-like** structure. Block-level elements begin on new lines.


Common **block-level elements** are `<div>`,`<p>`,`<article>`,`<section>`,`<figure>`,`<footer>` etc.



#### Inline Element : 
Inline as the name says "included as a part of the main text and not as a separate section". Inline elements occupy the space as needed within the space defined by the main element. Unlike block-level elements, they do not begin on new lines.

Some of the **inline elements** are `<a>`,`<span>`,`<img>`,`<code>`,`<cite>`,`<button>`,`<input>` etc.

***Note*** : Block-level elements may contain other block-level elements or inline elements. Inline elements **cannot** contain block-level elements.
