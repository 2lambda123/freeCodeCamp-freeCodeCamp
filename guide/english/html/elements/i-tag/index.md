## I Tag

The `<i>` element is used to set apart certain text from the surrounding text. By default, text wrapped in `<i>` tags are displayed in italic type. 

However, in modern semantic HTML, the `<i>` and `<b>` tags are being replaced by the `<em>` and `<strong>` tags because `<em>` and `<strong>` provide more accessibility for screen reader users.

Also, you can distinguish between different `<i>` elements by including a "class" attribute such as the following example.

```HTML
<p>The French phrase <i class="french">esprit de corps</i> is often 
used to describe a feeling of group cohesion and fellowship.</p>
```
