## Div Tag

The `<div>` tag is a generic container that defines a section in your HTML document. A `<div>` element is used to group sections of HTML elements together. `<div>` elements can be formatted using CSS. A `<div>` is a block-level element, meaning that it takes up its own line on the screen. Elements right after the `<div>` will be pushed down to the line below. For similar functinoality, but for inline grouping, reference the `<span>` tag.

### Example
Here is an example of how to display a section in the same color:

```html
<div style="color:#ff0000">
  <h3>my heading</h3>
  <p>my paragraph</p>
</div>
```
