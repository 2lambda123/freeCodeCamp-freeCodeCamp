# Img Tag

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The _image tag_ is used to include images in an HTML document.

```html
<img src="path/to/image/file" alt="this is a cool picture">
```

The `img` tag is self-closing. The `src` attribute provides a reference for the image to be displayed. This reference can be either an absolute path or a relative path to the image file.

The `alt` attribute provides alternate text for an image. Screen readers, often used by people who are visually impaired, read the value of the `alt` attribute inplace of displaying the image.
