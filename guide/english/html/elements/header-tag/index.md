## Header Tag

The `<header>` tag is a container which is used for navigational links or introductory content.
It may typically include heading elements, such as `<h1>`, `<h2>`, but may also include other elements such as a search form, logo, author information etc.

`<header>` tag is just a head of a section. It doesn't create new section.It is most common use to create a navigation bar inside the header tag.

Here's an example using the `<header>` tag:

```html
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Heading of Page</h1>
  </header>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
</article>
```
