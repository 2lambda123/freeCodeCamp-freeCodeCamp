**Some Useful STL Algorithms**
**-sort(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To sort the given vector.
**-reverse(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To reverse a vector.
** -*max_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the maximum element of a vector.
** -*min_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the minimum element of a vector.
** -accumulate(first_iterator, last_iterator, initial value of sum) – Does the summation of vector elements
