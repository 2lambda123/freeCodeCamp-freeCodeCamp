## What are Arrays?  
An array is a series of elements of the same data type which are stored in contiguous memory locations and can be referenced individually.  

For example, an array containing 5 integer values called numbers is declared like so:  
```C++
int numbers [5];
```

Initializiation:  
```C++
//Initialization with entries:
int numbers [5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

//Initialization with no values:
int numbers [5] = {};

//Initialization with declaration:
int numbers [] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
//Note that here the number of values defines the size of the array.
//In the examples above, the size was fixed beforehand
```
## Types Of Arrays
There are two types of array based on way, we declare it.

**1**. Static array:
Those arrays whose size is defined before compile time like in the examples above, are called static arrays. In these arrays we can't change their size, once they are declared.
e.g : int numbers [5];

**2**. Dynamic array:
Dynamic arrays are those arrays, whose size is not known at compile time and we can define their size at run time as need arises. These arrays are created by using **new** keyword and a pointer variable which points to the newly allocated memory location of the array. We can also free up the memory allocated once the array is not required anymore by using the **delete** keyword.
e.g : int * numbers = new int[5];

### Access:  
Elements from an array can be accessed via reference of their position in the array. (Start counting from 0).  
Example:  
```C++
x = numbers[0]; // = 1. [0] == first position
numbers[2] = 55; // Sets the third position (3) to the new number 55
//numbers[] is now: {1, 2, 55, 4, 5}
```
