## Augmented Reality Development on The Web

This section contains articles related to Augmented Reality Application Development using frameworks such as A-Frame, AR.js, Argon.js and Three.js. A-Frame and Three.js are capable of doing both Virtual and Augmented Reality development with only slightly different setup.

[A-Frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Frame_(virtual_reality_framework)) is an open-source web framework for building virtual reality experiences. It is an entity component system framework for Three.js where developers can create 3D and WebVR scenes using HTML, where HTML provides a familiar authoring tool for web developers and designers while incorporating a popular game development pattern used by engines such as Unity. A-Frame is maintained by developers from Supermedium and Google.
