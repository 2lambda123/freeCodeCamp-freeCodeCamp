## Augmented Reality Development on The Web

This section contains articles related to Augmented Reality Application Development using frameworks such as A-Frame, AR.js, Argon.js and Three.js. A-Frame and Three.js are capable of doing both Virtual and Augmented Reality development with only slightly different setup.
AR.js is an efficient Augmented Reality solution on the Web. It runs 100% in the web browser, and there is no need for a specific device either.
