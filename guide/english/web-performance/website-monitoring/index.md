## Website Monitoring

### Web and App Performance

Web Performance Monitoring is the measurement of a website’s or web service’s ability to respond efficiently to end-user interactions. Data gathered from monitoring helps to improve the service’s speed and ultimately increase user satisfaction resulting in higher user retention while reducing bounce rates and shopping cart abandonment. 

### What causes poor web performance?

Many things can cause a website or web service to perform poorly. File quantity, file sizes, system architecture, and user variables such as location, device, browser type, operating system, and connection speed all come together to form what could be a great or poor end-user experience. With dynamic distributed content, performance problems can manifest themselves at any point due to site changes or failing or inadequate hardware. Third party content often plays a role in poor performance, but identifying sluggish third party content can be difficult without Synthetic Web Performance Monitoring.

### Real User Monitoring and Performance

Real User Monitoring (RUM) is a passive approach to performance monitoring. The monitoring industry considers Real User Monitoring “passive” because the monitoring only occurs when a user accesses a page running a RUM script. The RUM script gathers detailed information about the user’s environment and reports the performance as experienced by the actual user. Real User Monitoring reports on:

1.Load Time
  .Time To First Byte
  .Page Ready Time

2.Network Duration
  .Redirect Duration
  .DNS Duration
  .Connect Duration

3.Backend Duration
  .Send Duration
  .Recieve Duration

4.Frontend Duration
  .DOM Duration
  .Render Duration

The performance data sorting options include page viewed, user location, browser type, operating system, and device type. Real User Monitoring gives detailed insights into a site’s performance when the site is available, but its passive nature makes it an unreliable tool for uptime reporting and other alerting needs. Synthetic monitoring is better suited to alerting a company to uptime and performance issues, while Real User Monitoring provides insights on how to structure the synthetic options and to get real insights into the site’s actual users’ experiences.

### Conclusion

After uptime monitoring, performance monitoring may be the single most important type of monitoring a company can conduct. Synthetic Performance Monitoring and Real User Monitoring offer active and passive monitoring allowing a brand to monitor their performance while seeing exactly how end users experience the site. The duel approach protects reputation and revenue.
