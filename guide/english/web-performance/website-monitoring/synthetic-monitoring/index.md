Synthetic Monitoring is basically a type of website monitoring, done using a web browser emulation or scripted recordings of web transctions. It works by issuing automated, simulated transactions from a robot client to the application in order to do what a typic user might do.

Synthetic monitoring is important because it helps a webmaster or IT professional in determining if a website or web application is slow or experiencing downtime before that problem starts to trouble end users or customers. If the synthetic tools are combined and used with traditional APM tools then it can help in providing deeper visibility into end-to-end performance, regardless of where applications are running.
