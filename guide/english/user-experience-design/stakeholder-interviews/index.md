## Stakeholder Interviews

Stakeholder interviews are goal-specific conversations with one or more people on the business side of a project, as typically differentiated from interviews with users. Stakeholders are people who have a stake in a successful outcome for a project. They can represent various roles, and levels of power and influence, within a business; they are the individuals who, including yourself, have a say in defining what "success"  means for a given project.<sup>1</sup>

Stakeholder interviews allow you to clarify the business motivations and objectives, constraints (technical and otherwise), and deadline(s) of a project. Other types of information include insight about stakeholders’ views on user needs, competitors, and  market outlook. The information gathered from these conversations helps to focus the design and development processes, so having these conversations as early as possible, and as frequently as necessary, is crucial.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

Efficient stakeholder interviews depend on preparation: Know your goals and what questions you want to ask; inform your interviewees of your goals and questions beforehand; allocate appropriate windows of time for the interviews; select physical environments that will support your intentions. During each interview, document everything shared, be available to new questions and possibilities as they arise, and seek to locate and understand any assumptions (hidden or not) that stakeholders are making about anything relevant to the project.<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> 

Stakeholders are sources of important information and influencers of a project, so take advantage of the interviews as a way to build a mutually-supportive rapport and to be on the "same page" with them.<sup>2</sup>

Because User Experience Design is a matter of meeting both user and business objectives, a product that has not achieved the objectives of the business will likely not be viewed as successful by the business, no matter how "good" users might deem the product.
