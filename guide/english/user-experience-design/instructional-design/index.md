## Instructional Design
### What is Instructional Design?
Instructional design is a method of developing education and training materials using defined, research-based processes.
### ADDIE Model
The ADDIE Model is a systematic approach to instructional design that utilizes distinct processes for instructional design. It was originally developed by instructors at Florida State University for the United States military in 1970.

The ADDIE Model consists of the following phases:
* Analysis
* Design
* Development
* Implementation
* Evaluation

The analysis phase of the ADDIE model is much akin to the reseach phase of design discovery. In this phase, the designer identifies the user and the problem. In doing so, the designer begins to formulate set goals and formulate questions that will help the designer bridge the gap between where the user is and where the designer wants him or her to go. When one starts the design process and he or she is actually building on the questions from the analysis phase and extrapolating the answers to those questions into the real world as sketches and prototypes. Then the development phase pushes it a step further and fleshes it out in to a fully-formed, learning object.

Itâ€™s easy, here, to stand on one's laurels, declare victory, and decide a project to be complete. However, these objects are living things that are always evolving and needing change. So, when one enters the implementation phase the designer has to monitor how and if things are working because intention does not necessarily match reality.

It should be noted that the acronym, ADDIE, is a bit of a misnomer. Evaluation should be conducted following each step in the process to make sure that goals are being met. Formative evaluation after every step in the process and summative evaluation after implementation at scale is recommended to ensure quality.
