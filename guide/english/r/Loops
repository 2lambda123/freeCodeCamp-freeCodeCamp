##Loop Statements

There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially.
*Repeat Loop*

The Repeat loop executes the same code again and again until a stop condition is met.

repeat {
commands
if(condition) {
break
}
}

*While Loop*

The While loop executes the same code again and again until a stop condition is met.
while (test_expression) {
statement
}

*For Loop*

A For loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute a specific number
of times.
for (value in vector) {
statements
}
Eg : v <- LETTERS[1:4]
for ( i in v) {
print(i)
