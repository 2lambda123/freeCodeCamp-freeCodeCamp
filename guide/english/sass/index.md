Sass is a preprossessor scripting language that compiles CSS. It essentially brings the power of a standard programming language (e.g. loops, variables, conditional statements, etc...) to your stylesheets.

With sass, you can not have a dynamic variable. Everything is set at compile time. It doesn't replace javascript, but just makes using css a lot faster and funner.
