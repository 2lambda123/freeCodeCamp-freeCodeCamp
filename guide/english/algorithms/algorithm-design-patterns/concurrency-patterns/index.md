## Concurrency patterns

Concurrency design patterns are those types of design patterns that deal with the multi-threaded programming paradigm.

Examples of Concurrency Patterns include:

1. **Active object**: decouples method execution from method invocation for objects that each reside in their own thread of control.
2. **Balking pattern**: executes an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.
3. **Barrier **:  a barrier is a type of synchronization method.
4. **Double-checked locking**: used to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the "lock hint") without actually acquiring the lock.
5. **Monitor (synchronization)**: synchronization construct that allows threads to have both mutual exclusion and the ability to wait (block) for a certain condition to become true.
6. **Reactor pattern**:  event handling pattern for handling service requests delivered concurrently to a service handler by one or more inputs.
7. **Scheduling (computing)**: assigned to resources that complete the work.
8. **Thread pool**: achieving concurrency of execution in a computer program.
