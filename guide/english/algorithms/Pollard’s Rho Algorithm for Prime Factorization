Given a positive integer n, and that it is composite, find a divisor of it.

Example:

Input: n = 12;
Output: 2 [OR 3 OR 4]

Input: n = 187;
Output: 11 [OR 17]
Brute approach: Test all integers less than n until a divisor is found.
Improvisation: Test all integers less than √n



 

A large enough number will still mean a great deal of work. Pollard’s Rho is a prime factorization algorithm, particularly fast for a large composite number with small prime factors. The Rho algorithm’s most remarkable success was the factorization of eighth Fermat number: 1238926361552897 * 93461639715357977769163558199606896584051237541638188580280321.
The Rho algorithm was a good choice because the first prime factor is much smaller than the other one.

Concepts used in Pollard’s Rho Algorithm:

Two numbers x and y are said to be congruent modulo n (x = y modulo n) if
their absolute difference is an integer multiple of n, OR,
each of them leaves the same remainder when divided by n.
The Greatest Common Divisor is the largest number which divides evenly into each of the original numbers.
Birthday Paradox: The probability of two persons having same birthday is unexpectedly high even for small set of people.
Floyd’s cycle-finding algorithm: If tortoise and hare start at same point and move in a cycle such that speed of hare is twice the speed of tortoise, then they must meet at some point.
Algorithm:

Start with random x and c. Take y equal to x and f(x) = x2 + c.
While a divisor isn’t obtained
Update x to f(x) (modulo n) [Tortoise Move]
Update y to f(f(y)) (modulo n) [Hare Move]
Calculate GCD of |x-y| and n
If GCD is not unity
If GCD is n, repeat from step 2 with another set of x, y and c
Else GCD is our answer
Illustration:
Let us suppose n = 187 and consider different cases for different random values.



 

An Example of random values such that algorithm finds result:
y = x = 2 and c = 1, Hence, our f(x) = x2 + 1.

An Example of random values such that algorithm finds result faster:
y = x = 110 and ‘c’ = 183. Hence, our f(x) = x2 + 183.

An Example of random values such that algorithm doesn’t find result:
x = y = 147 and c = 67. Hence, our f(x) = x2 + 67.
