Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray
Simple idea of the Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array (max_ending_here is used for this). 
And keep track of maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments (max_so_far is used for this). 
Each time we get a positive sum compare it with max_so_far and update max_so_far if it is greater than max_so_far
