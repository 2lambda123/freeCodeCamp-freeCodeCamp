### Prim's Algo for Minimum Spanning Tree

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. This algorithm is similar to Dijkstra's algo and uses min heap to find the minimun cost of forming a tree.
