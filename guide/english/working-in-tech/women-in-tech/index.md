## Women In Tech

From an article on ["The Latest Stats on Women in Tech"](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-latest-stats-on-women-in-tech),

> "We all know that there's a major gender gap when it comes to women in tech. 
>
> Although we make up the majority of the workplace and the social media sphere, we only represent a tiny percentage of the technology world.
>
> And that's reflected in some of the stats you see. For example, according to a 2011 report from the Level Playing Field Institute, 82% of men in startups believed their companies spent the 'right amount of time' addressing diversity, while almost 40% of women believed not enough time was devoted.‚Äù

Although women are still underrepresented in the tech world that does not mean that they are not making a difference in the tech world.

In a Women in Tech Round-up event presented by Google in Austin, women spoke who were vice presidents (VPs) and high-level managers from profitable tech companies. Not all of them had begun their careers in the tech world, in fact many had started as secretaries or had held other positions that are often geared towards women. They worked hard and took risks to get where they are now. The one piece of advice that seemed to resound from all of them was that for you to succeed you must take risks. 

The Google VP who spoke at this event gave women everywhere a piece of advice: that we should take any and every opportunity afforded to us and risk applying to jobs that we are under-qualified for. The worst that will happen is possible rejection or denial of an interview. Men get more tech positions not because they are more experienced or better than women. Men get more jobs because they take more risks in job application, perhaps even applying to positions that they are under-qualified for. Women seem to take less risks in job application, tending to only apply for jobs that they are sure they are qualified for. 
The worst thing you can do is to sell yourself short. If you want something, don't be afraid to take that risk and achieve the impossible.
