title: The Battle of Open Source
---

For someone new to software development, contributing to open source projects can seem daunting, even downright terrifying.  It was for me.  However, I can honestly say that participating in software development has been an unexpected journey that I have had the pleasure of taking.  Having the support from my family members and friends has made the journey less of a challenge; even so, it has not been an easy road. I've run into many road blocks in my path, but I keep challenging myself every day. Iâ€™ve read many articles suggesting that, as a junior software developer, it is important to contribute to open sources. I've searched the innerwebs for an open source project that I felt I could tackle easily.

The harsh reality is that contributing to open source projects out there is not quite as easy as I thought it would be. GitHub in general has been a challenge to learn, and while I feel like I learn something new each day, nevertheless after looking at several "beginner-friendly" open source projects, I've come to the stark realization that it is going to take much more time than I had thought to be able to contribute code to them. 

## Lessons Learned

Even though the above paragraph might seem a little off-putting, do not fret. Yes, Open Source Projects are nothing to take lightly; its  a serious business. Take your time, read the documentation or README's, do research, and never, ever give up or stop learning. No matter if you are a beginner or a seasoned developer there will always be something new to learn.
