## Dunning Kruger (DK) Effect

### Wikipedia's Definition
In the field of psychology, the **Dunningâ€“Kruger** effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude.

### Why does it matter in Software Development?


It is important for Software Developers to be aware of the DK Effect. This is more prominent among beginner and intermediate level developers but it can be seen among developers of all ages. After the initial struggle, they might become overconfident with their knowledge of a particular coding language or their designs. Consecutively, they are then lead to underestimate the complexity of some system requirements or, worse, hampers them coming up with better software designs. More experienced developers seem to have gained wisdom over the years. They are more humble and better at judging the system complexity. (This might not be true to all senior developers though.)

### Beware!
DK Effect is the exact opposite of [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). You need to strike the perfect balance between both of these for your professional growth. 

### How to check if I suffer from DK effect?
*You can't!* 

Sorry, but there isn't a straight answer to this question. You can ask yourself following questions:

 -  Am I able to give accurate estimates?
 -  Am I opened to learning new concepts?
 -  Am I opened to implement or try new design paradigms?
 -  Am I humble? 
 -  Am I able to take criticism and objectively evaluate feedback?
 -  Am I a good listener?
