## Code Documentation

Code documentation is a way developers write their code to create the best versions of their functions possible. Code Documentation lets the newbie to get comfortable with the customs of the particular module, functions etc for a particular programming language. It is always recommended to go with the documentation before debugging your code, this helps you to debug effectively.

## Why Documentation:

## 1.For You: 
    ~You will be using your code in 6 months
    ~You want people to use your code and give you credit
    ~You want to learn self-determination
    ~Others would be encouraged to contribute to your code
    
## 2.For Others: 
    ~Others can easily use your code and build upon it
    
## 3.For Science:
    ~Advance the science
    ~Encourage open science 
    ~Allow reproducibility and transparency

For example, if you happen to pass along your code to an absolute beginner, they should be able to follow along through comments, appropriate variable names and that means structuring the code in a spaced, readable manner. 

It may become an extremely important idea to make a habit out of commenting your functions, loops, and declarations and treating comments as part of the source code, just as regular code should be.

## Best practices for writing documentation:

1.Include A README file that contains.
    -A brief description of the project.
    -Installation instructions.
    -A short example/tutorial.
2.Allow issue tracker for others.
3.Write an API documentation.
    -What a function do.
    -What the function's parameters or arguments are.
    -What a function returns.
4.Document your code.
5.Apply coding conventions, such as file organization, comments, naming conventions, programming practices, etc.
6.Include information for contributors.
7.Include citation information.
8.Include licensing information.
9.Link to your e-mail address at the end.
10.List all the version of the files along with the major edits you did in each version.
