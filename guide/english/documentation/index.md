## Code Documentation

Code Documentation allows other developers (and yourself) to understand/remember the customs and purposes of particular pieces of code. It is recommended to use documentation before debugging your code, this helps you to debug effectively.

For example, if you happen to pass your code along to an absolute beginner, they should be able to follow along via external documentation, comments, and appropriate variable names, even if they have very little knowledge of the language in use.

It is a good idea to make a habit out of commenting your functions, loops, and declarations, and treating comments as part of the source code.

Many developers have learned that it is much harder to go back through your code and comment it after you finish. It's always a good idea to label and comment your code as you go, so that you don't forget or mix up what certain variables or functions do.
