## Code Documentation

Code Documentation allows other developers (and yourself) to understand/remember the customs and purposes of particular pieces of code. It is  recommended to use documentation before debugging your code, this helps you to debug effectively.

For example, if you happen to pass along your code to an absolute beginner, they should be able to follow along through comments, appropriate variable names and that means structuring the code in a readable manner. 

It is extremely important to make a habit out of commenting your functions, loops, and declarations and treating comments as part of the source code, just as regular code should be.
