## Code Documentation

Code Documentation is the tool developers use to make the purpose of their code clear. It's also called Commenting, but it's about more than just the comments you include with your code. It includes how you space and indent your code, name your variables, and give titles to various sections so it is easy to read and understand.

Code Documentation lets anyone (from newbie to seasoned expert) quickly get comfortable with the customs of the particular module, functions etc for a particular programming language. For example, if you pass your code to an absolute beginner, they should be able to follow along. Here is an article from Harry Roberts at CSS Wizardy Ltd. (https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) about structuring class names in CSS. This is just one example of good code documentation.

An excellent example of the value in good code documentation is the debugging process. The first step in debugging is to read the code documentation, right? But good code documentation goes beyond a readme file or header comments. Code Documentation means commenting every function, loop or declaration. It's having, and following, a variable naming process. And it means spacing and indenting your code so it's easy to read.

There is always the danger of over-commenting your code, too. Here is a video from Brian Voong where he discusses this danger and how to avoid it by using good naming conventions. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-KBQsTo8AY)

Have an interest in learning more and building your coding skills? Have a look at FreeCodeCamp.org. They have thousands of hours of free instruction that include how to comment and organize your code so it is well documented.
