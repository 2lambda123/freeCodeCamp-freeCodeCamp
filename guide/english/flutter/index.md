## Why choose Flutter?
- Cross-Platform: Flutter is Cross-Platform, that means you don't have to maintain a separate codebase for iOS or Android.
- Libraries: Flutter has a vast number of libraries provided by flutter team or 3rd party libraries for a great experience
  for any developer.
- The Google support: From GCP, Tensorflow to firebase, every Google product receives a great amount of attention in the
  developer community and that helps accelerate that products quality over the years, also google has been very active in promoting flutter. The flutter documentation is well written, and any beginner can easily go through it. There are tutorials online that help with the learning experience.
- UI/UX: Flutter is not just for programmers, its a tool for designers too, flutter makes it easy for everyone to make beautiful
  UI, and implement it in minimal lines of code.
- Dart: Dart is what is used to make a flutter app. It's java like syntax, makes it easier for a lot of people to start with flutter
  without learning dart specifically.
- Hot Reload: Feature like hot reload saves hours of debugging time, and seeing changes reflect on the emulator in less than a
  second is just an amazing feature that developers can't get enough of.
