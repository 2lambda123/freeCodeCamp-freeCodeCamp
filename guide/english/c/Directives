## Preprocessor Directive
*also called as macro's or preprocessor directive
* In the C Programming Language #define directive allows the definition of macros to be  your source code.
* Here if a macro once define in the program is used throughout the program.
* Macro definitions are not variables and cannot be changed by your program code like variables.
* The difference between variable declaration and macro definition declaration is that variables take memory after declaration 
  whereas macros dont.

## best example is 
 
```c
#define 
```
which is counterpart to variable declaration.

## #Define
used when you want to keep something ie value of a variable constant throughout the program.


## example

```c
#define PI 3.14

```

## 
it doesn't needs semicolon ';' to end.
according to good programing practices the variable declared should be capital so that it is identified as a constant value.
