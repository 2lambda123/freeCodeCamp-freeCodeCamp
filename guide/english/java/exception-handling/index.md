## What is an Exception?

An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions. Exceptions can be thrown either during run-time or during compile-time.

## Exceptions Types
1. Checked Exceptions: Exceptions that are checked during the compile-time.
2. Unchecked Exceptions: Exceptions that are checked during the run-time.

## Error vs Exception

* Error: An Error indicates serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
* Exception: Exception indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch.

Note: It is usually hard to reocover from errors, compared to Exceptions.

## Exception Hierarchy

All exception and errors types are sub classes of class Throwable, which is base class of hierarchy.One branch is headed by Exception. This class is used for exceptional conditions that user programs should catch. NullPointerException is an example of such an exception.Another branch,Error are used by the Java run-time system(JVM) to indicate errors having to do with the run-time environment itself(JRE). StackOverflowError is an example of such an error.

## Exception Handling
* Use try-catch (or try-catch-finally): Exceptions can be handled by catching specific exceptions using catch clause and handling each exception separately.
* Use throws clause: Exceptions can be thrown without being handled. If an exception happens, it has to be caught by the calling function.

## How to use try-catch clause

```
try {
// block of code to monitor for errors
// the code you think can raise an exception
}
catch (ExceptionType1 exOb) {
// exception handler for ExceptionType1
}
catch (ExceptionType2 exOb) {
// exception handler for ExceptionType2
}
// optional
finally {
// block of code to be executed after try block ends
}
```

## How to use throws clause

```
public methodName throws ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2{
  //some block of code
}

```
However, it is not recommended to throw exceptions without being handled.
