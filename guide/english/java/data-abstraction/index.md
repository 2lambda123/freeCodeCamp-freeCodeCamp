title: Data Abstraction
---

## Definition
As per dictionary, abstraction is the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.

Likewise in Object-oriented programming, abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.

In Java, abstraction is achieved using Abstract classes and interfaces.

Interfaces were introduced in Java to enhance Javaâ€™s single-inheritance model, multiple inheritance created too many problems for programmers and compiler writers. 
All methods in interface are public, we may not write it every time, like all of them are abstract, but we never write the key word abstract.
The interface should have at least one method but not too many.

Advantages using interfaces:
It decouples your code.
Helps in team corporation.
Increase your flexibility.
