## Java Bean

A JavaBean is a class that encapsulates many objects into a single object (the bean). It is serializable, has a zero-argument constructor, and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods. 

The name "Bean" was given to encompass this standard, which aims to create reusable software components for Java.
