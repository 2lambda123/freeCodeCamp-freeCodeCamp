In real life, a program consists of thousands lines of codes and dozens of classes so it is necessary and helpful to be able to draw a map
that connects the files and classes together. 

There are few types of representations of a program structure that can be drawn including a call graph, a type hierarchy, a sequence graph,
and a class diagram.

In this section, we will discuss about how to draw a type hiearchy that is correct and intuitive.
