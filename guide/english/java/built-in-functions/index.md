# Built-In Functions

Java also has many built-in or pre-defined functions which are usually stored in the java.lang and java.io packages,
which are automatically imported in editors like BlueJ or can be imported using the following Syntax-
```java
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;
```

These comprise functions which make an otherwise long and hard task easier to do.

Some of the commonly used function classes are found in ```java.lang.util``` and ```java.lang.Math```.
When in doubt, look to the Java docs to see if you can leverage an existing built in function.
