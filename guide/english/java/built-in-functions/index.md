# Built-In Functions

Java also has many built-in or pre-defined functions which are usually stored in the java.lang and java.io packages,
which are automatically imported in editors like BlueJ or can be imported using the following Syntax-
```java
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;
```
These comprise functions which make an otherwise long and hard task easier to do.

Importing java.lang.* imports all classes in the Java library. However, many programmers prefer to pick and choose individual classes because downloading all at once can clutter your local namespace and make your code harder to understand. Here is syntax for downloading just one class. 

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```
