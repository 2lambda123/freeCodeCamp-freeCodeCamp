## What is an Exception?

An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions.

## Error vs Exception

Error: An Error indicates serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
Exception: Exception indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch.

## Exception Hierarchy

All exception and errors types are sub classes of class Throwable, which is base class of hierarchy.One branch is headed by Exception. This class is used for exceptional conditions that user programs should catch. NullPointerException is an example of such an exception.Another branch,Error are used by the Java run-time system(JVM) to indicate errors having to do with the run-time environment itself(JRE). StackOverflowError is an example of such an error.

## How to use try-catch clause

```
try {
// block of code to monitor for errors
// the code you think can raise an exception
}
catch (ExceptionType1 exOb) {
// exception handler for ExceptionType1
}
catch (ExceptionType2 exOb) {
// exception handler for ExceptionType2
}
// optional
finally {
// block of code to be executed after try block ends
}
```
How Programmer handles an exception?

Customized Exception Handling :
Java exception handling is managed via five keywords: try, catch, throw, throws, and finally. Briefly, here is how they work. 
Program statements that you think can raise exceptions are contained within a try block. 
If an exception occurs within the try block, it is thrown. Your code can catch this exception (using catch block) and handle it in some rational manner. System-generated exceptions are automatically thrown by the Java run-time system. To manually throw an exception, use the keyword throw. Any exception that is thrown out of a method must be specified as such by a throws clause. Any code that absolutely must be executed after a try block completes is put in a finally block.
