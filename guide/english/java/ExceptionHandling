## What is an Exception?

An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions.

## Error vs Exception

Error: An Error indicates serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
Exception: Exception indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch.

## Exception Hierarchy

All exception and errors types are sub classes of class Throwable, which is base class of hierarchy.One branch is headed by Exception. This class is used for exceptional conditions that user programs should catch. NullPointerException is an example of such an exception.Another branch,Error are used by the Java run-time system(JVM) to indicate errors having to do with the run-time environment itself(JRE). StackOverflowError is an example of such an error.

## How to use try-catch clause

```
try {
// block of code to monitor for errors
// the code you think can raise an exception
}
catch (ExceptionType1 exOb) {
// exception handler for ExceptionType1
}
catch (ExceptionType2 exOb) {
// exception handler for ExceptionType2
}
// optional
finally {
// block of code to be executed after try block ends
}
```
## Types of Exception

  Java defines several types of exceptions that relate to its various class libraries. Java also allows users to define their own exceptions.Built-in exceptions are the exceptions which are available in Java libraries. These exceptions are suitable to explain certain error situations. Below is the list of important built-in exceptions in Java.

1.Arithmetic Exception
It is thrown when an exceptional condition has occurred in an arithmetic operation.
2.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
It is thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.
3.ClassNotFoundException
This Exception is raised when we try to access a class whose definition is not found
4.FileNotFoundException
This Exception is raised when a file is not accessible or does not open.
5.IOException
It is thrown when an input-output operation failed or interrupted
6.InterruptedException
It is thrown when a thread is waiting , sleeping , or doing some processing , and it is interrupted.
7.NoSuchFieldException
It is thrown when a class does not contain the field (or variable) specified
8.NoSuchMethodException
It is thrown when accessing a method which is not found.
9.NullPointerException
This exception is raised when referring to the members of a null object. Null represents nothing
10.NumberFormatException
This exception is raised when a method could not convert a string into a numeric format.
11.RuntimeException
This represents any exception which occurs during runtime.
12.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
It is thrown by String class methods to indicate that an index is either negative than the size of the string.
