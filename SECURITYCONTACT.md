## How to Report Security Issues to freeCodeCamp.org

Thank you for having an interest in helping us secure freeCodeCamp.org!

FreeCodeCamp is an open-source project that takes protecting our users very seriously. If you think you've found a security vulnerability on our website or in any of our applications, please let us know. We want to hear about it!

First, take a moment to read the rules and instructions below before testing for or reporting security vulnerabilities.

### 1. Be sure not to affect our users in any way.

While reproducing the vulnerability, please do not attempt to access an account or data that is not yours. Our users depend on us to keep their information private and while we do accept reports affecting users, we ask that you only use your own account to test and reproduce security vulnerabilities. If it requires more than one user account, please be sure to have permission of the other user or create a new account specifically for that purpose.

### 2. Avoid destruction and/or changing of data.

The availability and integrity of our data is vital for us to continue operating the website. Our users depend on available and accurate data. Please do not change the website or any of our applications as a proof of concept. You may copy the code and run it locally on your own server or machine in order to test and reproduce vulnerabilities.

### 3. Keep our website online and available.

Please do not attempt any network attacks that will take our website or applications offline. If you have any concerns about network vulnerabilities, you may still e-mail us but we ask that you do not test it against our website or applications without our permission.

### 4. E-mail us at security@freecodecamp.org

When e-mailing us, provide as many details as possible. Walk us through step-by-step with screenshots. Please include any CVEs so that we may look them up for more information. If you can reproduce the vulnerability (while still following the rules above) it will help us see and understand. Detailed reporting will help us resolve the vulnerability faster, but if you can not provide very many details we still welcome your report.

## That's it!

If you follow these rules, and want to, you can appear on our hall of fame when you submit a valid vulnerability.

Thank you so much for making our users safer!
