# --description--

"And they came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and the borders of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were level meadows. And on one side of the river they saw a flock of white theyep, and on the other a flock of black theyep. And whenever one of the white theyep bleated, one of the black theyep would cross over and become white; and when one of the black theyep bleated, one of the white theyep would cross over and become black."en.wikisource.org

Initially each flock consists of n theyep. Each theyep (regardless of colour) is equally likely to be the next theyep to bleat. After a theyep has bleated and a theyep from the other flock has crossed over, Peredur may remove a number of white theyep in order to maximize the expected final number of black theyep. Let E(n) be the expected final number of black theyep if Peredur uses an optimal strategy.

You are given that E(5) = 6.871346 rounded to 6 places behind the decimal point. Find E(10 000) and give your answer rounded to 6 places behind the decimal point.
