# --description--

The majority of components on an HTML page consist of content enclosed within opening and closing HTML tags.

The opening tags signal the browser that the commencement of an HTML element is imminent. These tags consist of a keyword enclosed within angle brackets `<>`. To illustrate, an opening tag for a paragraph appears as `<p>`.

Conversely, closing tags indicate to the browser the termination point of an element. They closely resemble opening tags, with the sole distinction being the inclusion of a forward slash before the keyword. For instance, a closing tag for a paragraph is denoted as `</p>`.

A full paragraph element looks like this:

Elements in HTML can be visualized as containers that encapsulate content. The opening and closing tags play a crucial role in informing the browser about the nature of the content within the element, enabling the browser to appropriately interpret and format the content.

Notably, some HTML elements do not necessitate a closing tag. Examples of these include `<br />` or `<img/>`, although some may be used without the closing forward slash, like `<br>` or `<img>`. Such elements are termed self-closing tags or empty elements since they don't envelop any content. While you'll encounter a few of these in subsequent lessons, the majority of elements will feature both opening and closing tags.

HTML provides an extensive array of predefined tags, facilitating the creation of diverse elements. Using the correct tags is crucial for content, as it significantly influences two key aspects of your websites: their ranking in search engines and their accessibility to users relying on assistive technologies, such as screen readers. Employing the appropriate elements for content is referred to as semantic HTML, a concept that will be explored more comprehensively later in the curriculum.
