# --description--

Change your `rows` declaration to be assigned an empty array again.

Also change your `'Hello'` string to use double quotes again. Generally it does not matter which of the two you prefer, but you will want to be consistent in that choice throughout your project.

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
--fcc-editable-region--
let symbol = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
--fcc-editable-region--
```
