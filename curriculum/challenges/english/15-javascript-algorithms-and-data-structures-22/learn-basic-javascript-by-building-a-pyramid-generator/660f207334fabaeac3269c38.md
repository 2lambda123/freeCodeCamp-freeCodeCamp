# --description--

To manipulate your `result` string, you are going to use another type of loop. This time, you will be using a `for...of` loop. This type of loop specifically goes through each item in an iterable value and assigns it temporarily to a variable.

The syntax for a `for...of` loop looks like:

```js
for (const value of iterable) {

}
```

Note that you can use `const` because the variable only exists for a single iteration, not during the entire loop.

Create a `for...of` loop to iterate through your `rows` array, assigning each value to a `row` variable.

Test 1

```js

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
const symbol = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(i)
}

let result = ""
