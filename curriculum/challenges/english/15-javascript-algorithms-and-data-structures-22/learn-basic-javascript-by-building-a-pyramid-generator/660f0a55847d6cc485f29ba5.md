# --description--

A <dfn>method</dfn> is a special function attached to certain values in JavaScript. You have already used a method without realising it - the `.log()` method of the `console` object.

Arrays have their own methods, and the first you will explore is the `.push()` method. This allows you to "push" a value to the end of an array. Here is an example to add the number `12` to the end of an array:

```js
array.push(12);
```

Use `.push()` to add the string `"freeCodeCamp"` to the end of your `rows` array. Add this code before your `console.log` so you can see the change you made to your array.

# --hints--

Test 1

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
let symbol = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
--fcc-editable-region--
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];

console.log(rows);
--fcc-editable-region--
```
