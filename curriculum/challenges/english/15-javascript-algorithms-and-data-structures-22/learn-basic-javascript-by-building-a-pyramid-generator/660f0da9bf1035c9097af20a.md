# --description--

You should have seen `"freeCodeCamp"` printed to the console. This is becuase `.pop()` returns the value that was removed from the array - and you pushed `"freeCodeCamp"` to the end of the array earlier.

But what does `.push()` return? Assign your existing `rows.push()` to a new `pushed` variable, and log it.

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
let symbol = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
--fcc-editable-region--
rows.push("freeCodeCamp");

--fcc-editable-region--
let popped = rows.pop();
console.log(popped);
console.log(rows);
```
