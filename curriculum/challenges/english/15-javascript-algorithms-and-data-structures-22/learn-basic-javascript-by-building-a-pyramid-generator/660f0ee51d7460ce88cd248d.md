# --description--

Were you expecting to see `4` in the console? `.push()` returns the new length of the array, after adding the value you give it.

It is important to be aware of what values a method returns. Take some time to experiment with `.push()` and `.pop()`. When you are ready, remove all of your `.push()` and `.pop()` calls, and your `console.log` statements.

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
let symbol = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
--fcc-editable-region--
let pushed = rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
console.log(pushed);
let popped = rows.pop();
console.log(popped);
console.log(rows);
--fcc-editable-region--
```
