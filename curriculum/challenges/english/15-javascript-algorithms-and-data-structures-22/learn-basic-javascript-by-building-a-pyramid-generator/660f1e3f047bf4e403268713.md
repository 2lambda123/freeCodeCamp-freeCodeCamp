# --description--

Unfortunately, now you cannot see what your loop is doing.

Use `let` to declare a `result` variable, and assign it an empty string. An empty string is represented by quotation marks with nothing between them, such as `""`.

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
const symbol = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(i)
}
