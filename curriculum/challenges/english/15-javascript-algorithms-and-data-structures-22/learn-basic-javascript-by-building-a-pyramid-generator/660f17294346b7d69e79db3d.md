# --description--

You are now ready to start building your pyramid generator. Your `symbol` variable will be the character that is used in the pyramid.

`"Hello"` might not work very well for that. Change the value of `symbol` to be the hash character `#`.

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
--fcc-editable-region--
const symbol = "Hello";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
--fcc-editable-region--
```
