# --description--

Your <dfn>iteration</dfn> statement will tell your loop what to do with the iterator after each run.

When you reassign a variable, you can use the variable to reference the previous value before the reassignment. This allows you to do things like add three to an existing number. For example, `bees = bees + 3;` would increase the value of `bees` by three.

Use that syntax to replace your `"iteration"` string with a reassignment statement that increases `i` by one.

# --hints--

Test 1

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
const symbol = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

for (let i = 0; i < count; "iteration") {

}

```
