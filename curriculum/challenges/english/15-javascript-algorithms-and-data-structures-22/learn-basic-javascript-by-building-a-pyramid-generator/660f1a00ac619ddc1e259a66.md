# --description--

The <dfn>condition</dfn> of a `for` loop tells the loop how many times it should iterate. When the `condition` becomes true, the loop will stop.

In JavaScript, a Boolean value can be either `true` or `false`. These are not strings - you will learn more about the difference later on.

For now, you will use the <dfn>less than<dfn> operator (`<`). This allows you to check if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. For example, `count < 3` would evaluate to `true` if `count` is `2`, and `false` if `count` is `4`.

Replace your `"condition"` string with a condition to check if `i` is less than `count`.
