# --description--

The `let` keyword allows a variable to be reassigned. This means you could change `symbol` later to be a completely different value.

For this project, you will not want to change these variable values. So instead, you should use `const` to declare them. `const` tells JavaScript that they are constants, and it will throw an error if you try to reassign them.

Replace your `let` keywords with `const`.

# --hints--

let rows = [];
