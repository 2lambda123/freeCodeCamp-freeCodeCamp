# --description--

Now you have a bunch of `#` symbols, but still no pyramid. Thankfully, your `i` variable represents the number of the "row" your loop is currently on, and you can use that to create a pyramid-like structure.

To do this, you will use the `.repeat()` method that strings have. The `.repeat()` method takes a number, which indicates how many times you would like to repeat the given string.

Use the `.repeat()` method on your `symbol`, and give it `i` for the number.

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
const symbol = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

--fcc-editable-region--
for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(symbol)
}
--fcc-editable-region--

let result = ""

for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + "\n" + row;
}

console.log(result);
```
