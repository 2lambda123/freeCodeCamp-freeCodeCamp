# --description--

Throughout the game, the player will be able to fight different monsters. You will need to keep track of the type of monster the player is fighting.

Use `let` to declare a variable called `fighting` but do not initialize it with a value. You are using `let` here because the value of `fighting` will change throughout the game.

# --hints--

You should use `let` to declare a variable called `fighting`.

```js
assert.match(code, /let\s+fighting/);
```

Your `fighting` variable should not have a value.

```js
assert.isUndefined(fighting);
```

You should not assign a value to your `fighting` variable. 

```js
assert.match(code, /let\s+fighting;?/);
```
