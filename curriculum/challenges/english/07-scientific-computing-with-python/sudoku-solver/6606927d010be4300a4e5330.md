# --description--

The instantiation creates an empty object. But classes can have methods, which are like local functions for each instance. Within a class, methods are declared as follows:

```py
class ClassName:
    def method_name():
        pass
```

Inside the `Board` class, replace `pass` with an empty method `spam`.
