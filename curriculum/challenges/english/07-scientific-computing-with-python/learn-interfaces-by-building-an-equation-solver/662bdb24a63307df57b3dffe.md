# --description--

As expected, no exception is thrown. Another aspect to take into account is that `Equation`, the class you want to act as interface, at the moment is just a regular class.

Nothing prevents you from creating an instance of `Equation`, as well. Verify it by instantiating an `Equation` object and assigning it to a variable `eq`.

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
--fcc-editable-region--
class Equation:
    def solve(self):
        pass
        
    def analyze(self):
        pass
        

class LinearEquation(Equation):
    pass
    
lin_eq = LinearEquation()
