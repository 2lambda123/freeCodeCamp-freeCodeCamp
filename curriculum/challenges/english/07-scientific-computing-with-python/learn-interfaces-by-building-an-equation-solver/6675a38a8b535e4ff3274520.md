# --description--

The `hasatttr` built-in function takes an object as its first argument and a string representing an attribute name as its second argument. It returns a boolean indicating if the object has the specified attribute.

Now you are going to use the `__init_subclass__` method to check if the child class has the `degree` attribute at the moment of the instantiation.

Create an `if` statement to check if `cls` does not have a `degree` attribute. If so, raise an `AttributeError` and use the string `f"Cannot create '{cls.__name__}' class: missing required attribute 'degree'"` to provide a custom message.

After that, fix the error that has appeared in the terminal by declaring a `degree` class attribute inside the `LinearEquation` class. This attribute should represent the degree of the equation, which is the exponent of the highest \\( x \\) term. Therefore, the integer `1` to the `degree` atttribute.
