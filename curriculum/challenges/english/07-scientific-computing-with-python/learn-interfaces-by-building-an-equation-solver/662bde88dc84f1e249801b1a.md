# --description--

`ABC` stands for *Abstract Base Classes*. The `ABC` class enables you to turn a regular class into an abstract class that acts as a blueprint for concrete classes.

Two key features of abstract classes are:

- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated
- Concrete classes inheriting from the abstract class are enforced to implement all the methods and properties defined within the abstract class

Turn your `Equation` class into an abstract class by making it inherit from `ABC`.

class Equation:
    def solve(self): pass
        
    def analyze(self): pass
        
class LinearEquation(Equation): pass
    
eq = Equation()
lin_eq = LinearEquation()
