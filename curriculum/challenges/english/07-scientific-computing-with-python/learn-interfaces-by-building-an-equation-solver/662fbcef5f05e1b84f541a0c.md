# --description--

Each equation object will be instantiated passing as many arguments as they are the coefficients of the equation, including the possible coefficient with the value `0`.

Add the following docstring at the beginning of the class body:

```py
"""Equation objects are instantiated providing the equation coefficients as arguments.
The coefficient order goes from the n-th grade of x to the zero-th grade.
Coefficients with the value of zero must be specified.
"""
```
