# --description--

Each equation object will be instantiated passing as many arguments as the coefficients of the equation, starting from n-th grade of `x` to the zero-th grade, including the possible coefficient with the value of `0`.

You need to check that the right number of arguments is passed to instantiate the equation object.

Inside the `__init__` method, create an `if` statement to check if the length of `args` is different from the number of coefficients the equation should have (`grade + 1`). If it is, raise a `TypeError` and use the following string to provide a custom message: `f"'Equation' object takes {self.grade + 1} positional arguments but {len(args)} were given"`.

Then, fix the error by passing the strings `'2'` and `'3'` to instantiate `lin_eq`.
