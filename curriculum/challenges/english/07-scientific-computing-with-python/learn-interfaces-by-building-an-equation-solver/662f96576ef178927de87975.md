# --description--

In order to be recognized as an abstract method, a method should be decorated with the `@abstractedmethod` decorator.

Modify your import statement to import the `abstractmethod` decorator and prepend it to both the `solve` and `analyze` methods. This will raise two exceptions.

Once a class inheriting from `ABC` implements an abstract method, the class cannot be instantiated anymore. Therefore, delete the `Equation` instance to get rid of the error.

The other error occurs because the `LinearEquation` class must implement all the abstract methods defined in the interface. Make sure to define them inside the `LinearEquation` class, too.

class Equation(ABC):
    def solve(self): pass

class LinearEquation(Equation):
    pass
    
eq = Equation()
