# --description--

You want the `LinearEquation` class to implement and not simply inherit all the methods defined inside the `Equation` class, which should act as an interface.

Currently, nothing prevents you from creating an instance of `LinearEquation` without implementing the methods defined inside `Equation`.

Verify that by creating an instance of `LinearEquation` and assigning it to a variable `lin_eq`.

# --hints--

Test 1

## --seed-contents--

```py

class Equation:
    def solve(self):
        pass
        
    def analyze(self):
        pass
        

class LinearEquation(Equation):
    pass
