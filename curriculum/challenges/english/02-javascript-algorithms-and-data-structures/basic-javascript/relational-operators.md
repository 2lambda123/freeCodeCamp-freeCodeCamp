Greater than (>) - Imagine you are playing a racing game and your car has a value of 7. Your opponent's car has a value of 5. You can use the greater than operator (>) to see if your car won the race. In this case, 7>5 (True), so your car won!
Less than (<) - Pretend you are baking cookies and the recipe calls for 4 cups of flour. You only have 3 cups of flour. You can use the less than operator (<) to see if you have enough flour. In this case, 4<5 (True), so you have enough flour to bake your cookies!
Greater than or equal to (>=) - You are climbing a mountain and you need to reach an altitude of at least 6,000 feet to reach the peak. Your altimeter shows that you are currently at 6,500 feet. You can use the greater than or equal to operator (>=) to see if you have reached the peak. In this case, 6,500>=6,000 (True), so you have reached the peak!
Less than or equal to (<=) - You are going to a party and your mom says you have to be home by 10 o'clock. You look at your watch and it shows 9:45. You can use the less than or equal to operator (<=) to see if it is past your curfew. In this case, 9:45<=10 (True), so it is not past your curfew yet.
Equal to (==) - You are collecting baseball cards and you are looking for a specific card. The card you are looking for has a player number of 55. You find a card that has a player number of 55. You can use the equal to operator (==) to see if it is the card you are looking for. In this case, 55==55 (True), so you found the card you were looking for!
Not equal to (!=) - You are helping your friend set the combination for their new bike lock. The combination is not supposed to be 4, 1, and 5. You accidentally set the combination to 4, 1, and 5. You can use the not equal to operator (!=) to see if the combination is correct. In this case, 4, 1, 5 != correct combination (True), so the combination is not correct.
