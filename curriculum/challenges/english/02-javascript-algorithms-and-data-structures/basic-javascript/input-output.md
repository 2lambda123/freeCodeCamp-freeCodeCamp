# --description--

Let’s understand how computers work on our commands.
Input: 
Think of input, like giving instructions or information to a computer or a program. When you input something, you're giving data or commands to the program. You can capture user input using the prompt() function in JavaScript.

Output: 
Output is what the computer or program gives back to you after it processes the input. It's like the response you get. You could see this on the screen, like text or images.
In Javascript, output is displayed on the screen using console.log().

Example:
let name = prompt(“Enter your name”)
console.log(name)
