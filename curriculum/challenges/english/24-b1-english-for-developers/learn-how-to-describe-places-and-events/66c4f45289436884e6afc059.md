<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: I think we are, but maybe it's not set up right. -->

# --description--

The phrase `set up right` means to configure something correctly so that it works as expected. If something isn’t `set up right`, it might not function properly.

For example:

- `The printer isn’t working because it’s not set up right.` - This means the printer isn’t configured correctly.

- `Make sure the software is set up right before you start using it.` - This means you need to configure the software correctly to ensure it works.
