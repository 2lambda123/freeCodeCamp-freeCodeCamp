# --description--

Negative contractions with the verb `to be` are common in English. They are used to make sentences shorter and more natural. For example:

- `They're not` is a contraction of `they are not,` which is used to say that something is not true or not happening.

- `Isn't` is a contraction of `is not,` which is also used to express that something is not true or not happening.

In Sarah's sentence, she uses `they're not` to explain that the Git tools are not visible, and `isn't` to say that the project is not linked to Git.
