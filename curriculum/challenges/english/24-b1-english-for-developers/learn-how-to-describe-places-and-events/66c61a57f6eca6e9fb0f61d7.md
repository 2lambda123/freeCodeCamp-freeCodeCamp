<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: And in Eclipse, it’s not showing the Git tools. Are they built in? -->

# --description--

`Built-in` refers to features or tools that are included as part of a software program or device from the start, without needing to be added or installed separately.

When something is `built in`, it’s already there and ready to use.

For example:

- `This laptop has a built in camera.` - This means the camera is included as part of the laptop.
- `The software comes with built in security features.` - This means the security features are already included in the software.
