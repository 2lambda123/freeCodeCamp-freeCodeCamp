<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: Itâ€™s not showing the Git tools. Are they built in? -->

# --description--

When Tom asks if the Git tools are built-in, he is checking if they are included in Eclipse by default.

If Sarah wants to confirm that the Git tools are indeed built-in, she would respond in a way that reassures Tom that the tools should be there without needing to be added.

# --questions--

## --text--

What could Sarah answer to Tom if she wanted to confirm that the Git tools are built-in?

---

`They might be built-in, but they don't work on all projects`.

### --feedback--

If you pick this option Sarah will be expressing uncertainty. She won't be confirming that the tools are built-in.
