<!-- Audio Reference:
Sarah: Not always, but they can be when they're not set up properly. -->

# --explanation--

The word `when` is used here to describe a specific condition or situation that causes something to happen. 

In Sarah’s sentence, `when` introduces the condition where the IDEs become tricky: `if they’re not set up properly`. For example:

- `The program crashes when it runs out of memory.` - The condition of running out of memory causes the program to crash.
- `The printer only works when it’s plugged in.` - The condition of being plugged in allows the printer to work.

In both cases, `when` is used to explain the situation in which something occurs.
