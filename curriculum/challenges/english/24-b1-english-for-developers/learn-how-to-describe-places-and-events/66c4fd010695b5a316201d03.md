<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: Also, in IntelliJ IDEA, the code auto-completion isn't popping up. -->

# --description--

`IntelliJ IDEA` is a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used by developers to write, test, and debug code. It is known for its powerful features, including `auto-completion`, which helps you code faster by suggesting possible completions as you type. 

When Tom says that `auto-completion isn’t popping up`, he means that the feature, which normally suggests code as you type, isn’t appearing on the screen like it should.
