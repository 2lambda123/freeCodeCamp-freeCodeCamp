<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: Also, in IntelliJ IDEA, the code auto-completion isn't popping up. Isn’t it automatic? -->

# --description--

A `tag question` is a short question added to the end of a sentence to confirm or check something. It's often used when the speaker expects the listener to agree with them. For example, when Tom says, `Isn’t it automatic?`, he is asking for confirmation that the auto-completion should happen automatically.

For example:

- `It’s a nice day, isn’t it?` - The speaker expects that the listener will agree that it’s a nice day.
- `They are coming to the meeting, aren’t they?` - The speaker expects that the listener will agree that they are coming to the meeting.
