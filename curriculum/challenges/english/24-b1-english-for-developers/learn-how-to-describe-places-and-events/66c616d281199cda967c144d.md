Sometimes, when you’re not sure if you’ve done something, it’s important to say that you’re unsure. For example, you can use the sentence:

`I'm not sure.`

 In this case, Tom isn’t sure if he has checked the settings, so he needs to tell Sarah that he will check them again. 
 
 `I'll have to check again`
