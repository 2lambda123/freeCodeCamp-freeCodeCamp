<!-- Audio Reference:
Sarah: Is your project connected to Git in Eclipse? -->

# --explanation--

Sometimes, when you're not completely sure about something, but you believe it should be true, you can use the phrase `It’s supposed to` + verb. 

This will express that something is expected to be a certain way, even if you haven’t confirmed it yet. For example:

- `The update is supposed to fix the bug.` - This means you expect the update to fix the bug, but you haven’t confirmed it yet.
