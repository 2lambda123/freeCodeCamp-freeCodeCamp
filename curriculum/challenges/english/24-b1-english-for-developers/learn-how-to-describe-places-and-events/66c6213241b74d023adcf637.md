<!-- Audio Reference:
Sarah: Is your project connected to Git in Eclipse? -->

# --description--

When forming questions in English with the verb `to be`, the usual word order of the subject and verb is inverted. This means that the verb comes before the subject. 

For example:

- `Your project is connected to Git.` (Statement)

- `Is your project connected to Git?` (Question)

In Sarahâ€™s sentence, she uses this inversion to ask Tom if his project is connected to Git in Eclipse.
