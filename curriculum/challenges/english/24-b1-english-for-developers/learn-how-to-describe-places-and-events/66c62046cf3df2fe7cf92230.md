<!-- Audio Reference:
Sarah: Yes, they are, but they're not visible if the project isn't linked to Git. -->

# --description--

Sarah explains that the Git tools are built-in, but they won’t be visible unless a specific condition is met. 

To understand this, pay attention to the word `but`, which signals a contrast or exception. 

After `but`, Sarah mentions `they're not visible`, followed by the condition `if the project isn't linked to Git.` 

This tells you that the tools are hidden unless the project is connected to Git. 

The phrase `if the project isn't` is a key marker that introduces the condition under which the Git tools won’t appear.
