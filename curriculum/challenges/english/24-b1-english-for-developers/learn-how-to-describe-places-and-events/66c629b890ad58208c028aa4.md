`Walk` refers to moving step by step, usually on foot.
`Through` means moving from one side to another or from start to finish.

When these words are combined into `walkthrough`, it means a step-by-step explanation or guide to help someone understand how to do something.For example:

- `The software includes a walkthrough to help new users get started.` - This means there is a guide that explains each step to using the software.

- `Let me give you a walkthrough of the process.` - This means the speaker will explain each step of the process in detail.
