Task 27 Type 19

<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: Also, in IntelliJ IDEA, the code auto-completion isn't popping up. Isn’t it automatic?

Sarah: It usually is, but it doesn't work if the project isn't set up right. Have you checked the settings?

# --description--


Cause and effect sentences are used to explain why something happens.

The cause is the reason something happens, and the effect is what happens as a result. 

When interpreting a sentence like Sarah’s, look for the word `if`.

This word often introduces the cause of a problem, explaining what needs to happen for something else to occur. 

After finding `if`, identify the part of the sentence that describes what happens when that condition isn’t met (the effect). In Sarah’s sentence:

**Effect:** `The auto-completion doesn’t work`.
**Cause:** `If the project isn’t set up correctly` (introduced by `if`).

Understanding this relationship helps you explain problems and solutions clearly.
