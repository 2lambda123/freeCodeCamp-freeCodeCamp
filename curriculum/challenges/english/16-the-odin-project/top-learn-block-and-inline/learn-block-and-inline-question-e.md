# --description--

You can't talk about `block` and `inline` elements without discussing `div`s and `span`s. All the other HTML elements you have encountered so far give meaning to their content. For example, paragraph elements tell the browser to display the text it contains as a paragraph. Strong elements tell the browser which texts within are important and so on. Yet, divs and spans give no particular meaning to their content. They are just generic boxes that can contain anything.
