# --description--

As you’ve seen, flexbox is not just a single CSS property but a whole toolbox of properties that you can use to put things where you need them. Some of these properties belong on the flex container, while some go on the flex items. This is a simple yet important concept.

A flex container is any element that has `display: flex` on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container.

It shows a .container with CSS properties including background-color: lightblue;, padding: 16px;, border: 4px solid blue;, margin: 8px;, and display: flex;. Inside the container are .item elements with their own CSS properties: background-color: peachpuff;, border: 4px solid salmon;, height: 48px;, flex: 1;, and padding: 4px;. The container is labeled as 'flex container' and the items within as 'flex-items', visually explaining how CSS Flexbox properties are applied to create a flexible and responsive layout.">
