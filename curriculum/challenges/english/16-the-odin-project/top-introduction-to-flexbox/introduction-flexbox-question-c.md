Somewhat confusingly, any element can be both a flex container and a flex item. Said another way, you can also put `display: flex` on a flex item and then use flexbox to arrange its children.

<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/odin-project/flex-box/flexbox-03.png" style="width: 95%; height: 95%;" alt="This image demonstrates a nested CSS Flexbox layout. It features a larger blue rectangle. Inside the red rectangle, there are two peach-colored rectangles, identified as 'flex items'. The layout shows that a flex container can nest within another flex container, and both can have their own flex items, illustrating the concept of nesting flex containers in a Flexbox layout." />

Creating and nesting multiple flex containers and items is the primary way you will be building up complex layouts. The following image was achieved using only flexbox to arrange, size, and place the various elements. Flexbox is a very powerful tool.

<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/odin-project/flex-box/flexbox-02.png" alt="The image displays a CSS Flexbox layout with nested flex containers. The outer container, outlined in blue, encompasses three orange containers, each labeled as 'flex-items'. The central orange container, which also serves as a 'flex-item', contains two red containers. An arrow points to this orange container, indicating that it is not only a 'flex-item' but 'ALSO a flex container'. The red containers inside are further labeled as 'flex-items', illustrating the concept of nesting within Flexbox, where a flex item can also be a flex container."/>
Certainly, the image features a representation of a CSS Flexbox layout with nested flex containers. The outer container is denoted as "ALSO a flex container" highlighted in blue, and within it is another container marked as "with flex items" in red. Inside the red container, there are three items labeled as "flex items" in peach. This demonstrates that a flex container can be nested within another flex container and contain its own flex items, showcasing the recursive nature of Flexbox layout structures.
