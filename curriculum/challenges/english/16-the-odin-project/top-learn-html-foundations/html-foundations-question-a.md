# --description--

Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.

Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element. They are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets `<>`. For example, an opening paragraph tag looks like this: `<p>`.

Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends. They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword. For example, a closing paragraph tag looks like this: `</p>`.

A full paragraph element looks like this:

The image shows a basic HTML paragraph element. It consists of an opening tag <p>, followed by the words 'some text content' representing the content of the paragraph, and concludes with a closing tag </p>. There are labels pointing to each part: 'Opening Tag' at the beginning, 'Content' in the middle, and 'Closing Tag' at the end.">
