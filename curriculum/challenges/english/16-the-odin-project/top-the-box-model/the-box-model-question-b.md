In the Elements pane, you can see the entire HTML structure of your page. You can click on any of the elements in this pane to select that specific element. Alternatively, you can click the blue-highlighted icon shown below on the left, and hover over any element on the page.

The image shows a screenshot of a web development environment, specifically the browser's developer tools. There is a highlighte blue inspector icon in the top-left. The icon suggests that the user can click it to select an element on the webpage and view its corresponding HTML structure and styles within the developer tools panel.">

When an element is selected, the Styles tab will show all the currently applied styles, as well as any styles that are being overwritten (indicated by a strikethrough of the text). For example, if you use the inspector to click on the “Your Career in Web Development Starts Here” header on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">the The Odin Project homepage</a>, on the right-hand side you’ll see all the styles that are currently affecting the element, as seen below:

It highlights the CSS rules for a .hero_main-heading class, where margin-bottom: 100px; is marked as the currently applied style. There's also a padding-bottom property set to 1.875rem. Below this, the .accent class sets the color property to #ce973e. The h1 element has several style rules, including font-size, font-weight, and letter-spacing. Notably, margin-bottom: 2rem; for the h1 element is crossed out, indicating it has been overridden by another style rule, likely the one specified in .hero_main-heading.">
