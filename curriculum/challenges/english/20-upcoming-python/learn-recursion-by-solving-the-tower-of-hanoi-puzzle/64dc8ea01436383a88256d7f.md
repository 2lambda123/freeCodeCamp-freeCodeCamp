# --description--

The puzzle starts with the disks piled up on the first rod, in descreasing size. You need to populate your first list with numbers representing the various disk sizes.

Instead of adding items manually to the first list, generate the sequence of numbers from `3` to `1` by using the `range()` function and assign it to `rods['A']`.

The sintax is `range(start, stop, step)`, where `start` is your starting integer, `stop` is the last integer (not inclusive), and `step` is the difference between one number and the following one.

# --hints--

You should use the `range()` function to assign `rods['A']` a sequence of numbers.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
  a = __locals.get('rods')
  type(a['A']) is range
  `))
})
```

You should use the `range()` function to assign `rods['A']` the sequence of numbers from `3` to `1`.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
 a = __locals.get('rods')
 a['A'] == range(3, 0, -1)
  `))
})
```
