# --description--

Although sometimes could be less easy to understand, the recursion give you the power of creating a very concise code. In this case, you don't even need to differentiate between even and odd number of disks. As a final step, set `NUMBER_OF_DISKS` to 5 and check the output.

Well done. You have completed the Tower of Hanoi practice project.

Test 1

```py

NUMBER_OF_DISKS = 4
rods = {
    'A': list(range(NUMBER_OF_DISKS, 0, -1)),
    'B': [],
    'C': []
}

def move(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n > 0:
        # move n - 1 disks from source to auxiliary, so they are out of the way
        move(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)
        
        # move the nth disk from source to target
        rods[target].append(rods[source].pop())
        
        # display our progress
        print(rods, '\n')
        
        # move the n - 1 disks that we left on auxiliary onto target
        move(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)
              
# initiate call from source A to target C with auxiliary B
move(NUMBER_OF_DISKS, 'A', 'C', 'B')
