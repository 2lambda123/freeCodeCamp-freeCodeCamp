# --description--

Although sometimes could be less easy to understand, the recursion gives you the power of creating very concise code. In this case, you don't even need to differentiate between even and odd number of disks. As a final step, set `NUMBER_OF_DISKS` to 5 and check the output.

Well done. You have completed the Tower of Hanoi practice project.

# --hints--

You should set the `NUMBER_OF_DISKS` variable to 5.

```js
({test: () => assert.equal(__userGlobals.get('NUMBER_OF_DISKS'), 5) })
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
--fcc-editable-region--
NUMBER_OF_DISKS = 4
A = list(range(NUMBER_OF_DISKS, 0, -1))
B = []
C = []

def move(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n > 0:
        # move n - 1 disks from source to auxiliary, so they are out of the way
        move(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)
        
        # move the nth disk from source to target
        target.append(source.pop())
        
        # display our progress
        print(A, B, C, '\n')
        
        # move the n - 1 disks that we left on auxiliary onto target
        move(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)
              
# initiate call from source A to target C with auxiliary B
move(NUMBER_OF_DISKS, A, C, B)
--fcc-editable-region--
```

# --solutions--

```py
NUMBER_OF_DISKS = 5
rods = {
    'A': list(range(NUMBER_OF_DISKS, 0, -1)),
    'B': [],
    'C': []
}

def move(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n > 0:
        # move n - 1 disks from source to auxiliary, so they are out of the way
        move(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)
        
        # move the nth disk from source to target
        rods[target].append(rods[source].pop())
        
        # display our progress
        print(rods, '\n')
        
        # move the n - 1 disks that we left on auxiliary onto target
        move(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)
              
# initiate call from source A to target C with auxiliary B
move(NUMBER_OF_DISKS, 'A', 'C', 'B')
```
