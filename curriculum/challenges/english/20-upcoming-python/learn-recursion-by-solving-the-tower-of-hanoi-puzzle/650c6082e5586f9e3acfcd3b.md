# --description--

Now, delete the `rods` dictionary and turn its keys into the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`, respectively, keeping their values. Refactor your code to reflect these changes. If you see the output on the terminal you made it. 

# --hints--

You should turn `rods['A']` into a variable named `A` keeping its value.

```js
({ test: () => assert.match(code, /A\s*=\s*list\s*\(\s*range\s*\(\s*NUMBER_OF_DISKS\s*,\s*0\s*,\s*-\s*1\s*\)\s*\)/) })
```

You should turn `rods['B']` into a variable named `B` keeping its value.

```js
({ test: () => assert.match(code, /B\s*=\s*\[\s*\]/) })
```

You should turn `rods['C']` into a variable named `C` keeping its value.

```js
({ test: () => assert.match(code, /C\s*=\s*\[\s*\]/) })
```

You should refactor your code after deleting the `rods` object.

```js
({ test: () => {
  assert.match(code, /print\s*\(\s*A\s*,\s*B\s*,\s*C\s*,\s*('|")\\n\1\s*\)/);
  assert.match(code, /move\s*\(\s*NUMBER_OF_DISKS\s*,\s*A\s*,\s*C,\s*B\s*\)/);
} })
```
