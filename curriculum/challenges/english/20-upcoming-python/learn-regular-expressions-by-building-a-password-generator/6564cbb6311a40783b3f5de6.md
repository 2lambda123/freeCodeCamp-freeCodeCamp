# --description--

In this case, `None` is returned because `ac` does not match `abc`. A pattern wrote in this way requires an exact match. But you have multiple options to have flexibility in your patterns.

A character class is identified by a pair of square brackets and only one character out of those specified inside the character class is matched.

Modify your pattern into `[ac]` and see the ouput.

    symbols = string.punctuation

    # Combine all characters
    all_characters = letters + digits + symbols

    password = ''
    # Generate password
    for _ in range(length):
        password += secrets.choice(all_characters)
        
    return password
