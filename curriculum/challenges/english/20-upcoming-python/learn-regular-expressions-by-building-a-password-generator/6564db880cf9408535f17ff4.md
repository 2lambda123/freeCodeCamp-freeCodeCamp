# --description--

Python provides a particular type of strings called *raw* strings. Raw strings are prefixed with a `r` or `R` and the main difference respect to a regular string is that they treat the backslash character as a regular character and not as an escape character. When writing regular expressions, using raw strings is a good practice, since they can usually contain a lot of `\` characters.

Turn your string pattern into a raw string by prefixing it with a `r`.

def generate_password(length, nums, special_chars, uppercase, lowercase):
    
    # Define the possible characters for the password
    letters = string.ascii_letters
    digits = string.digits
    symbols = string.punctuation

    # Combine all characters
    all_characters = letters + digits + symbols

    while True:
        password = ''
        # Generate password
        for _ in range(length):
            password += secrets.choice(all_characters)

            (nums, '\d')
        ]

    return password
    

#new_password = generate_password(8)
#print(new_password)

```
