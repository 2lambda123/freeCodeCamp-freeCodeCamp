# --description--

A graph is called a weighted graph when its edges are associated with weights, representing a distance, time or other.
In your case, these weights will be the distances between each node, or point in space.
To represent a weighted graph you can modify your dictionary, using a list of tuples for each value.
The first element in the tuple will be the connected node, and the second element will be the distance.

Change your dictionary according to the following distances:

A-B = 3
B-C = 4
C-D = 7
D-A = 1
