# --description--

The other bug is subtle. When a shorter distance is found for a neighbour node, `paths[current]` gets assigned to the neighbour node path, `paths[node]`. This means both variables point to the same list. Since lists are mutable, when you append the neighbour node to its path, both `paths[node]` and `paths[current]` are modified, because they are the same list. This results in wrong paths, altough the distances are correct.

Fix that bug by assigning a copy of `paths[current]` to the neighbour node path.

    'D': [('C',1 ), ('E', 9), ('F', 3)],
    'E': [('A', 11), ('C', 5), ('D', 9)],
    'F': [('B', 2), ('D', 3)]

    paths = {node: [] for node in graph}
    paths[start].append(start)
    
    while unvisited:
        current = min(unvisited, key=distances.get)
        for node, distance in graph[current]:
            if distance + distances[current] < distances[node]:
                distances[node] = distance + distances[current]

                else:

                paths[node].append(node)
