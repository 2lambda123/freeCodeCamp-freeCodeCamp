# --description--

I think you got the idea. Now your dictionary has been magically transformed for you into something slightly more complex.
Try to figure out how this graph looks like (you can try to sketch it using circles connected by straight lines).

Now you are going to start developing the algorithm to calculate the shortest path between each node in your graph. 
Declare an empty function called `shortest_path` and don't forget the `pass` keyword. 

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
--fcc-editable-region--
my_graph = {
    'A': [('B', 5), ('C', 3), ('E', 11)],
    'B': [('A', 5), ('C', 1), ('F', 2)],
    'C': [('A', 3), ('B', 1), ('D', 1), ('E', 5)],
    'D': [('C',1 ), ('E', 9), ('F', 3)],
    'E': [('A', 11), ('C', 5), ('D', 9)],
    'F': [('B', 2), ('D', 3)]
}
