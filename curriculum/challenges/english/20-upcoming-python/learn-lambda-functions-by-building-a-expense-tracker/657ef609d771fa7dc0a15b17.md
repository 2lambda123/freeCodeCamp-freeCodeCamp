# --description--

In Python, the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that your script runs only when it is executed directly, not when imported as a module in another script. This is a common practice in Python to provide a starting point for a program.

Here's an example of how you might use this:

```py
def some_function():
    print("Function is running")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    some_function()
```

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block needs to be written at the end of this expense tracker program. Inside this block, the `main` function is called. This will be the entry point of the expense tracker program. 

This is the code that was added:

```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Congratulations. You have completed the Expense Tracker practice project.
