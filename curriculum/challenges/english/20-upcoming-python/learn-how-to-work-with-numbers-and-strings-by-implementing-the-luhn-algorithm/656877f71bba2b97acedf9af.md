# --description--

Python comes with built-in modules that can help us with string manipulation. One of them is the `str` module. It has a method called `maketrans` that can help us create a translation table. This table can be used to replace characters in a string:

```python
str.maketrans({'t': 'c', 'l': 'b'})
```

The above, when called on a string, will replace all `t` characters with `c` and all `l` characters with `b`.

Create a variable called `card_translation` and assign it a translation table to replace all `-` and ` ` characters with an empty string.
