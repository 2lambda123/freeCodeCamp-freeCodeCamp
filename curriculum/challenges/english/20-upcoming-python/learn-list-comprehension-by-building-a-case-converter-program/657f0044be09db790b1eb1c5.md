# --description--

Now that you have a function that can convert pascal or camel cased strings to snake cased string, you can put it into action. To do so, create another function called `main()` in your code. This will be the entry-point for this program.

Even though the concept of an entry-point function doesn't exist in the Python programming languages, you can impose such a discipline by making sure that the Python interpreter only runs the `main()` function if you run the script directly.

Use the `def` keyword like the first step. The `main()` in this example doesn't accept any parameters. Do not forgot the collon at the end.

    for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string:
        if char.isupper():
            snake_cased_char_list.append(f'_{char.lower()}')
        else:
            snake_cased_char_list.append(char)
    snake_cased_string = ''.join(snake_cased_char_list)

    return snake_cased_string.strip('_')
