# --description--

If the input string was in pascal case, it would've had its first character in uppercase. Since you have converted all uppercase characters to lowercase and prepended an underscore to them, chances are the converted snake case string has an underscore in front of it.

The simplest way to get rid of any such character is by calling the `strip()` method on the joined string and passing an underscore as the parameter. You can also return the stripped string from the function as the output as follows:

```python
return snake_cased_string.strip('_')
```

That concludes your `convert_to_snake_case` function implementation.

            snake_cased_char_list.append(f'_{char.lower()}')
        else:
            snake_cased_char_list.append(char)
    snake_cased_string = ''.join(snake_cased_char_list)
