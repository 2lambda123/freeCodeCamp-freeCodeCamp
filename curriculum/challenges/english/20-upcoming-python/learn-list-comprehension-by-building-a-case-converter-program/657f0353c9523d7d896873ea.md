# --description--

Now that the `main()` function is complete, all that is left is to call the function and see the magic happen. Like I said before, Python doesn't have the idea of an entry-point to a program.

To impose such a discipline in Python, you need to use an `if` statement as follows:

```py
if __name__ == '__main__':
```

You can run a Python script directly or you can import a Python script inside another one and execute functions from the first script inside the second one. In cases where you run the script directly, it gets the name `__main__` automatically.

This value is saved inside the `__name__` variable. This is attribute is a part of the interpreter itself and is used to uniquely identify the Python file itself.

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    snake_cased_char_list = []
    for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string:
        if char.isupper():
            snake_cased_char_list.append(f'_{char.lower()}')
        else:
            snake_cased_char_list.append(char)
    snake_cased_string = ''.join(snake_cased_char_list)

    return snake_cased_string.strip('_')

def main():
    input_string = 'aLongAndComplexString'
    output_string = convert_to_snake_case(input_string)
    print(output_string)
