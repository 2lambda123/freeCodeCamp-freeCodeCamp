# --description--

Now inside the `for` loop you'll get access to each character of the string via the target variable. You need to determine whether the character is in uppercase or lowercase. An uppercase character in camel case or pascal case indicates the start of a new word.

In snake case however all the characters are lower case and an underscore indicates the start of a new word. So, you need convert all the uppercase character to lowercase and prepend an underscore to do them.

You can use an `if` statement in conjunction with the `isupper()` string method to determine whether a character is in uppercase or not.
