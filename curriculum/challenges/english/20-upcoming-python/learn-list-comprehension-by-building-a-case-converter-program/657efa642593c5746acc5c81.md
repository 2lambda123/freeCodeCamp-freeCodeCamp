# --description--

Assuming that the character inside the target variable is in uppercase, you will need to convert it to lowercase and prepend an underscore to it. You can do that using a f string.

A f string is a string with superpower. You can turn any string to a f string by prepending the letter `f` to it. Unlike regular strings, you can put dynamic expressions or variable names directly in a f string by surrounding them inside a set of curly braces.

For example, assuming the value of `char` is `A`, `f_{char.lower()}` will be interpreted as `_a`, which means the expression inside the curly braces will be replaced by its calculated value.

Now you can append this converted character to the list of snake cased character using the `append()` list method.
