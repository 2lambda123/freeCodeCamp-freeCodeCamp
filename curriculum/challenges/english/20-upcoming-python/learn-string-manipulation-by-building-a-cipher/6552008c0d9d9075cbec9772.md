# --description--

The first kind of cipher you are going to build is called a *Caesar* cipher. Specifically, take each letter in your message, see its position in the alphabet, take the letter located after 3 positions, and replace the original letter with that.

Start by finding the position occupied by the first letter in the string. One way is to use the built-in `find()` function:

```py
a_string.find(char)
```

Above, `char` is the character you want to locate, and `a_string` is the string you want to parse.

At the end of your code, call `find()` on your `alphabet` string and pass `text[0]` to the function.

# --hints--

You should call the `find()` function.

```js
({ test: () => assert.match(code, /find\s*\(.*\)/) })

```

You should call the `find()` function on the `alphabet` variable.

```js
({ test: () => assert.match(code, /alphabet\.find\s*\(.*\)/) })

```

You should call the `find()` function on the `alphabet` variable and pass `text[0]` to the function.

```js
({ test: () => assert.match(code, /alphabet\.find\s*\(\s*text\[\s*\s*0\s*\]\s*\)/) })

```

text = 'Hello World'
shift = 3
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
