# --description--

In this project, you will learn about classes and objects by building a sudoku puzzle solver.

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects created from a class are instances of that class. You can create a class using this syntax:

```js
class class_name:
```

First, you will create a 9x9 board by using classes and then populate it with the puzzle values.

Begin by creating a `Board` class.
