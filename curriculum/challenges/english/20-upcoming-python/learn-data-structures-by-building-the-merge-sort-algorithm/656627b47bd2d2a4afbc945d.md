# --description--

In the previous step, we got the mid point. You can use it to divide `array` into two and assign each part to new variables. 

You can slice and extract certain portions of a data structure using the slice notation (`:`). 

In the code below, a `left_part` variable has been created. We assigned `array[:middle_point]` to the variable which denotes every element from the beginning of `array` to the `mid_point`.

Create a `right_part` variable and assign all the elements from the `mid_point` to the end of `array` to it.


# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
def merge_sort(array):
    
    middle_point = len(array) // 2
```

```py
--fcc-editable-region--
    left_part = array[:middle_point]

--fcc-editable-region--
```
