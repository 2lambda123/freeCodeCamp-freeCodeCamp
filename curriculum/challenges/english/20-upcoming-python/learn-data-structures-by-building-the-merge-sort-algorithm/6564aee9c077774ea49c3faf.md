# --description--

The merge sort algorithm mainly performs three actions recursively: divide, conquer, and merge. Let's start with "divide".

You can get the number of elements in an object using the `len()` function. You can divide the total number of elements in an object by 2 to get the mid point of the object.

Here's an example:

```py
random_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]

numbers_mid_point = len(random_numbers) // 2

print(numbers_mid_point)
# 3
```

In the code above, we got the mid point of the `random_numbers` list by dividing its length by 2. When printed to the console, the index of the mid point is returned.

Create a `mid_point` variable. Then divide the length of `array` by 2 and assign it to the `mid_point` variable, just like in the example above.
