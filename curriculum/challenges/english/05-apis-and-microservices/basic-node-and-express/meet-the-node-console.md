# --description--

Start this project on Repl.it using <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-express'>this link</a> or clone <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-express/'>this repository</a> on GitHub. If you use Repl.it, remember to save the link to your project somewhere safe.

During the development process, it is important to be able to check whatâ€™s going on in your code.

Node is just a JavaScript environment. Like client side JavaScript, you can use the console to display useful debug information. On your local machine, you would see console output in a terminal. On Repl.it, a terminal is open in the right pane by default.

We recommend to keep the terminal open while working at these challenges. By reading the output in the terminal, you can see any errors that may occur.

# --instructions--

Modify the `myApp.js` file to log "Hello World" to the console.

# --hints--

`"Hello World"` should be in the console

```js
(getUserInput) =>
  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/hello-console').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.isTrue(data.passed, '"Hello World" is not in the server console');
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```

# --solutions--

```js
/**
  Backend challenges don't need solutions, 
  because they would need to be tested against a full working project.
