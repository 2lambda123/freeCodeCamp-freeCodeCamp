# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --question--

## --text--

Based on the dialogue, which sentence shows the correct use of `going to` based on present evidence?

## --answers--

`We will probably use React since it's a popular choice these days.`

### --feedback--

This sentence uses `will` for a probable future action, which lacks the sense of a decision made based on present evidence.

---

`I think we will go with Node.js for the backend, considering our team's expertise.`

### --feedback--

Here, `will` is used for a future action based on a current situation, but `going to` would be more appropriate as the decision seems based on the team's present expertise.

---

`We're going to need a UX designer because the project is complex.`

---

`I will call the designer since we're going to need one for this project.`

### --feedback--

This sentence uses `will` for a spontaneous decision (`calling the designer`), which is appropriate, but it doesn't illustrate the use of `going to` based on present evidence.
