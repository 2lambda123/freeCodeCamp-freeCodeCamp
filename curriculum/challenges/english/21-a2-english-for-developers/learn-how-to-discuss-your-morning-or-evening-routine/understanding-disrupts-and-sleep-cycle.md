# --description--

`To disrupt` is a verb that means to interrupt or prevent something from continuing in its usual way. 

The term `sleep cycle` refers to the natural pattern of sleep, including different stages the body goes through while sleeping. 

For example:
`Loud noises disrupt my concentration.` (interrupts the concentration)

`A good sleep cycle is vital for restful sleep.` (refers to a healthy pattern of sleep)
