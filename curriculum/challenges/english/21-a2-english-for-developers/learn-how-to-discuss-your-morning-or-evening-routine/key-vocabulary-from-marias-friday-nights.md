# --description--
A `night owl` is someone who stays up late.`Hang out` means to spend time relaxing or socializing. `Be back` means to return, and `tops` is used informally to indicate the maximum amount or time. 

For example:

`I'll be back by dinner` (returning before a specific time)

`The meeting will last one hour, tops` (no longer than one hour)

`We hang out at the park on weekends` (spending leisure time)

`He's a night owl, often working past midnight` (stays up late)

Listen to Maria's description of her Friday nights and identify the usage of these phrases.
