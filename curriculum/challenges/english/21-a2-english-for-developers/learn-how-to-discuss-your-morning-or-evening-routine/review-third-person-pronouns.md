# --description--

Let's review the usage of `them`and `their` 

`Them` is used to refer to multiple people previously mentioned, and `their` shows possession or belonging to these people. For example:

`I saw the kids. I gave them their toys.` (‘them’ refers to the kids; ‘their’ shows the toys belong to the kids)

In Jake's sentence, `them` refers to his kids, and `their` indicates something belonging to the kids, in this case, homework.
