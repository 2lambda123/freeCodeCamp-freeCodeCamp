# --description--

The words `before` and `after` are used to describe the order of events in time. 

`Before` is used to talk about something that happens earlier than another event, and `after` is used for something that happens later. 

For example:

- `I brush my teeth before I have breakfast` (Brushing teeth happens first)

- `I go to work after I have breakfast` (Going to work happens later)

In this dialogue, James uses one of these words to ask about the next step in Sarah's routine. Identify which word is used.
