# --description--

The past continuous tense is used to talk about actions that were ongoing in the past. 

It is formed using `was` (`I, he, she, it`) or `were` (`you, we, they`) followed by a verb ending in `-ing`. 

For example, `I was working` means the work was happening over a period of time in the past. 

It's often used when an action is interrupted by another, as in `I was reading when the phone rang.`
