# --description--

`Overall` means considering everything or in general. 

For example, `Overall, the project was successful despite some minor issues.` It is used to summarize a general opinion or situation taking all aspects into account.

# --question--

## --text--

What is Sophie's `overall` opinion about the new design?

## --answers--

She thinks the design is perfect and doesn't need any changes.

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect. Sophie's comments suggest she sees areas for improvement, not that the design is perfect.

---

She doesnâ€™t know and needs more time to form an opinion.

### --feedback--

Sophie expresses specific concerns, indicating she has formed an opinion rather than being undecided.

---

She dislikes everything about the new design.

### --feedback--

Sophie's feedback is specific to certain elements (color scheme and font), not a dislike of the entire design.

---

She believes it needs improvements, particularly in the color scheme and font choice.
