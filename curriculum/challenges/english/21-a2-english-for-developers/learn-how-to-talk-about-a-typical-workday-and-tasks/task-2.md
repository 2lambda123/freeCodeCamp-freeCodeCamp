# --description--

Prepositions of time are essential in English to talk about when something happens. 

The preposition `at` is used to specify exact times of the day. 
For example, you say 'at 8:30 AM' to indicate a specific hour. Other examples include 'at 12:00 PM' for noon, 'at 6:00 AM' for early morning, and 'at 10:15 PM' for late at night.


`At` is used for specific times of the day (e.g., 'at 8:30 AM'), `in` is used for months, years, centuries, and long periods (e.g., `in April`, `in 2022`, `in the morning`), and `on` is used for days and dates (e.g., `on Monday`, 'on July 4th').

| On (for days and dates)                             | `Our team meets on Mondays.` `The coding class is on April 10th.` `I finished the task on the last day.`                    |
| At (for specific times of the day)                  | `Our meeting is at 9 AM.` `I begin coding at 10 AM.` `We have lunch at 12 PM.`                                              |
