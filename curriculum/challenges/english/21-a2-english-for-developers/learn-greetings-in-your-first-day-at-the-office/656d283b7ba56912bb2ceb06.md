Tom: Thanks, Jake. Is it contactless?

# --description--

Tom's question `Is it contactless?` refers to a specific item mentioned by Jake. The word `contactless` usually describes a type of technology where you don't need to physically touch or swipe something. For example, tapping a card against a scanner instead of inserting it. Notice that `Is it` is used to ask for specific information about that item.
