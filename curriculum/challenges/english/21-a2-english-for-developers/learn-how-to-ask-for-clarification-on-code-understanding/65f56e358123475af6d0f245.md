# --description--

Adverbs describe how you do something.

- When you add `ly` to an adjective, it usually turns the word into an adverb. For instance, `careful` (adjective) becomes `carefully` (adverb). 

- `Carefully` means doing something with a lot of attention to avoid mistakes or accidents. Example: `She codes carefully to avoid errors.`

- `Slowly` is used when something is done without speed, taking time. Example: `He reads the code slowly to understand each part.`

- `Quickly` means doing something fast. Example: `She quickly found the bug in the code.`

Remember, `ly` adverbs indicates how an action is performed, which can be useful in many situations, like coding or problem-solving.
