# --description--

`Patterns` are regular and repeated ways in which something happens or is done. In data, patterns can show trends or behaviors. 

For example, a pattern in customer data might be that more people buy ice cream on hot days. This is a `trend pattern`.

There are also `cycle patterns`, like a coffee shop selling more coffee in the morning. 

Recognizing patterns helps businesses understand their customers better. 

`Patterns` can be found in numbers, like sales increasing every month, or in behaviors, like customers preferring to shop online.
