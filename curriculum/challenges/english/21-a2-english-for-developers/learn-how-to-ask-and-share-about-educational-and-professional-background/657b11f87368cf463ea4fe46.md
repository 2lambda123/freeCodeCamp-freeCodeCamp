# --description--

Questions in the past tense often start with the auxiliary verb `were` or `was`, followed by the subject and then the main verb. This structure helps in asking about past events or experiences. For example, `Were you at the meeting yesterday?` uses this question form. It's important to recognize and understand this form to follow and participate in conversations about past events.
