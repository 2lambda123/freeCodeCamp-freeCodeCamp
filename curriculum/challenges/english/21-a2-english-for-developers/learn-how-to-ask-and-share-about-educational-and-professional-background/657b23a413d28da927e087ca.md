# --description--

This task reviews how an adverb is often formed by adding '-ly' to an adjective. For example, `quick` (adjective) becomes `quickly` (adverb). Adverbs describe how, when, where, or to what extent something is done. However, not all adverbs follow this pattern. For instance, `most` is an adjective meaning the greatest in amount or degree, while `mostly` is an adverb meaning mainly or generally.
