<!-- (Audio) Sophie: I didn't study computer science at university, but I majored in electrical engineering. -->

# --description--
When you want to create a negative sentence about the past, you can do this by adding `didn't` in front of most verbs.
`Didn't` is short for `did not`. 

Remmeber that the main verb stays in its simple form. So, if you want to say that you did not eat, you would say `I didn't eat`. The word `eat` does not change; you simply put `didn't` before it to show the action was not done.

# --question--

## --text--

If someone says that `Sophie didn't study computer science`, what could you understand from this sentence?

## --answers--

Sophie enjoyed the computer science degree

### --feedback--

Using `didn't` suggests she did not study it, contradicting the idea of enjoying it.

---

Computer science is not something Sophie studied in college

---

Sophie always studies computer science

### --feedback--

This expression refers to a regular habit, not a specific event in the past.

---

Sophie is looking forward to studying computer science

### --feedback--

This option is about future anticipation.
