# --description--

This dialogue uses a contraction in the present perfect tense. `I've` is a contraction of `I have`, and it's common in informal English. Other similar contractions include `you've` (you have), `we've` (we have), and `they've` (they have). These contractions make speech and writing more fluid and natural.
