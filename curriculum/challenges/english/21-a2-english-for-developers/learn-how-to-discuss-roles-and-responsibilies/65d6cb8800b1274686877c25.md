<!-- (Audio) Alice: She's very easygoing, actually. -->

# --description--

The word `easygoing` describes someone who is relaxed and not easily upset or worried. An `easygoing` person is comfortable to be around because they do not get stressed or angry easily. For example, `My team leader is very easygoing, which makes working on projects less stressful.`

The word `actually` is used to add new, often surprising information or to correct something. For example, `I thought the test was next week, but it's actually tomorrow.` Here, `actually` shows that the real test date is surprising or different from what I thought.
