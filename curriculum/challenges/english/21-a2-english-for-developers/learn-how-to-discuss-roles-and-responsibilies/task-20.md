AUDIO REFERENCE:
Tom: Hey, have you ever worked with Anna from HR?
-->

# --description--

In the dialogue, `have you ever worked with` uses the present perfect tense in a question form, combined with `ever`. Itâ€™s formed with `have/has` and the subject (`you`/`she`) plus the past participle of a verb, like `worked`. It's used to talk about experiences that have happened at any time in a person's life up to now. `Ever` in questions asks if something has happened at any time in the past, suggesting a broad, unspecified time frame.
