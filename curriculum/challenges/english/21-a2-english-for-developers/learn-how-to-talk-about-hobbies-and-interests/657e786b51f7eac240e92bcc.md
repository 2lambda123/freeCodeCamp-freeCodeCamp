# --description--

The phrase `would you like` is a polite way to offer something or ask someone if they want something. If you are offering something, you can name it after the expression `would you like`. For example, you might say `Would you like some coffee?` when offering coffee to a guest. If you are offering to do something, for example, `going shopping`, don't forget to add a `to` between the expression and the action. For example: `Would you like to go shopping?`. Finally, if you are asking someone if you should do something for them, use `me` between `would you like` and `to`. For example: `Would you like me to make some coffee?`.
