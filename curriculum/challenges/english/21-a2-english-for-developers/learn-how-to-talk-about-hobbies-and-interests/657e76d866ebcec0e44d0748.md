<!-- (Audio) Jake: I haven't been on a bike since I was a kid. -->

# --description--

In the Present Perfect Tense, to make a sentence negative, you add `not` after `have` or `has`. This way, you can talk about something that has not occurred lately. 

For example, if Jake wants to say it's been a long time since he was on a bike for the last time, he can say, `I have not been on a bike since I was a child.`.

In this sentence, you could also be abbreviated the verb `have`: `I haven't been on a bike since I was a child.`
