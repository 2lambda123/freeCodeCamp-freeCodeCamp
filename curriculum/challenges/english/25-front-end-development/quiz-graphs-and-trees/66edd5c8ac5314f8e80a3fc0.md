### --question--

#### --text--

Maximum degree of a `simple graph` can be?

#### --distractors--

Self loop in a graph provides degree 2

---

Sum of all degrees of a graph is 2 times number of the edges of the graph

---

The graph is considered as a simple graph by default

#### --answer--

Number of vertices of graph - 1

### --question--

#### --text--

What is an `Euler` graph?

#### --distractors--

A graph which does not contain even length cycle.

---

A graph in which half of the vertices have odd degree.

---

A graph in which all vertices have odd degree except one.

#### --answer--

A graph in which degree of all vertices are even.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the number of `odd degree` vertices in a graph?

#### --distractors--

It is always even.

---

It can be even as well as odd.

---

It is always odd.

#### --answer--

It is always even.

### --question--

#### --text--

A graph sometimes can be called as which other `data structure` and why? 

#### --distractors--

A non linear data structure as it can be represented as a matrix.

---

A non linear data structure as it can be represented as linked list.

---

A linear and non-linear data structure.

#### --answer--

A graph is called as tree when there is no cycle presented and the leaf nodes are presented.

### --question--

#### --text--

A graph contains `dense edges`. What is best way to store it?

#### --distractors--

It contains few vertices. Adjacency List is best.

---

It can be store in any way.

---

Many entries in the adjancency matrix will be empty so it is not a good way.

#### --answer--

Adjancency matrix is good to store it because only some entries in the matrix will be empty. 

### --question--

#### --text--

Which operation has the `same` complexity on `both` the representation of graph?

#### --distractors--

Removing an edge which takes O(N) time.

---

Removing an edge which takes O(1) time.

---

Adding an edge which takes O(N) time.

#### --answer--

Adding an edge which takes O(1) time.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which operation takes `O(N*N)` time and in which representation of graph?

#### --distractors--

Removing an edge in Adjacency List.

---

Removing an edge in Adjancency Matrix.

---

Initializing an edge in Adjacency List.

#### --answer--

Initializing an edge in Adjacency Matrix takes O(N*N) complexity.

### --question--

#### --text--

What are the `special cases` of graph?

#### --distractors--

A tree is the only special case of a graph.

---

A network graph is the special case of a graph.

---

Tree and Linked List are the special cases of a graph.

#### --answer--

Trees, Linked List and Heaps are special cases of a graph.

### --question--

#### --text--

What are `spanning trees`?

#### --distractors--

Minimum subgraph of a graph is known as spanning tree.

---

Minimum subgraph which contains minimum weight is known as spanning tree.

---

Minimum subgraph which contains all the edges is known as spanning tree.

#### --answer--

A subgraph that is a tree and includes all the vertices of the original graph is known as spanning tree. 

### --question--

#### --text--

Which basic algorithm of graph uses `queue` data structure?

#### --distractors--

When we have to visit all the nodes from a single node , we store every node in a queue.

---

Bellman Ford and Prim's algorithm are the only algorithm which uses queue data structure.

---

We can use queue data structure in every algorithm in graph.

#### --answer--

BFS is the basic algorithm which uses queue data structure.

### --question--

#### --text--

A `scatterplot` displays the relationship between study hours and exam scores for a group of students. If the points on the scatterplot show a clear upward trend, what can be inferred?

#### --distractors--

Students who study more tend to have lower exam scores.

---

The data shows a perfect linear relationship between study hours and exam scores.

---

There is no relation between study hours and scores.

#### --answer--

Increased study hours are associated with higher exam scores.

### --question--

#### --text--

Tanuj is comparing the average monthly temperatures in two cities, Nainital and Koorg, over a year using a `bar graph`. If the bar graph shows that Nainital has consistently higher temperatures than Koorg, what conclusion can be drawn?

#### --distractors--

Nainital is located closer to the equator than Koorg because its temperature is increasing.

---

Nainital experiences milder weather year-round compared to Koorg.

---

Nainital has lower temperatures than Koorg in the winter months.

#### --answer--

Nainital has higher average monthly temperatures than Koorg throughout the year.

### --question--

#### --text--

Anjali wants to find the strongly connected components in a `directed `graph. Suggest her the most `optimal algorithm` for this.

#### --distractors--

She can find strongly connected components using BFS.

---

Kosaraju's Algorithm is the most optimal algorithm for finding strongly connected components.

---

Tarjan's algorithm which uses BFS is the most optimal algorithm for this.

#### --answer--

Tarjan's algorithm which uses only one DFS traversal is the most optimal for finding strongly connected components in directed graphs.

### --question--

#### --text--

A developer wants to compress the data which is coming in its application. Suggest him the best `data structure` for this.

#### --distractors--

Linked List

---

Trees

---

Graphs

#### --answer--

Tries

### --question--

#### --text--

The left node of the root of a Binary Search Tree has a value 131. Gukesh wants to find the node which has value 158. Which side he will start traversing? 

#### --distractors--

He will first go to the root of the tree, then start traversing towards left.

---

He will start traversing towards left from the node which has value 131.

---

It cannot be judged because he has to traverse all the node to find the node which has value 158.

#### --answer--

He will start traversing right from the given node because 158 is greater than 131.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which `data structure` is also known as `digital tree`?

#### --distractors--

A Binary Search Tree because it can store elements in a sorted order.

---

A Binary Tree because it has less use case in real world.

---

A graph because it can be tree in special cases.

#### --answer--

Trie is known as digital tree or prefix tree.
