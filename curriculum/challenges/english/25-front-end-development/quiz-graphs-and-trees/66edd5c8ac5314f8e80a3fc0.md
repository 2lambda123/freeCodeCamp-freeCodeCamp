### --question--

#### --text--

Maximum degree of a `simple graph` can be?

#### --distractors--

Self loop in a graph provides degree 2

---

Sum of all degrees of a graph is 2 times number of the edges of the graph

---

The graph is considered as a simple graph by default

#### --answer--

Number of vertices of graph - 1

### --question--

#### --text--

What is an `Euler` graph?

#### --distractors--

A graph which does not contain even length cycle.

---

A graph in which half of the vertices have odd degree.

---

A graph in which all vertices have odd degree except one.

#### --answer--

A graph in which degree of all vertices are even.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the number of `odd degree` vertices in a graph?

#### --distractors--

It is always even.

---

It can be even as well as odd.

---

It is always odd.

#### --answer--

It is always even.

### --question--

#### --text--

A graph sometimes can be called as which other `data structure` and why? 

#### --distractors--

A linear data structure as it can be represented as a matrix.

---

A non linear data structure as it can be represented as linked list.

---

A linear and non-linear data structure.

#### --answer--

A graph is called as tree when there is no cycle presented and the leaf nodes are presented.

### --question--

#### --text--

A graph contains `dense edges`. What is best way to store it?

#### --distractors--

It contains few vertices. Adjacency List is best.

---

It can be store in any way.

---

Many entries in the adjancency matrix will be empty so it is not a good way.

#### --answer--

Adjancency matrix is good to store it because only some entries in the matrix will be empty. 

### --question--

#### --text--

Which operation has the `same` complexity on `both` the representation of graph?

#### --distractors--

Removing an edge which takes O(N) time.

---

Removing an edge which takes O(1) time.

---

Adding an edge which takes O(N) time.

#### --answer--

Adding an edge which takes O(1) time.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which operation takes `O(N*N)` time and in which representation of graph?

#### --distractors--

Removing an edge in Adjacency List.

---

Removing an edge in Adjancency Matrix.

---

Initializing an edge in Adjacency List.

#### --answer--

Initializing an edge in Adjacency Matrix takes O(N*N) complexity.
