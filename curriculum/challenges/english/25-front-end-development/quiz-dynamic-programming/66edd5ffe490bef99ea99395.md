Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem just once, storing the solutions for future use.

### --question--

#### --text--

What are the two main properties that a problem must have to be solved using dynamic programming?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

Optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems

### --question--

#### --text--

What is memoization in dynamic programming?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

Memoization is a technique where you store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.

### --question--

#### --text--

How does dynamic programming differ from divide and conquer?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

Dynamic programming solves each subproblem only once and stores the results, while divide and conquer may solve the same subproblem multiple times.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the time complexity of the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming? 

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

O(n)

### --question--

#### --text--

What is a greedy algorithm?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving problems by making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the difference between dynamic programming and greedy algorithms?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

Dynamic programming solves problems by combining solutions to subproblems and storing results, while greedy algorithms make a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment.

### --question--

#### --text--

Give an example of a problem that can be solved using a greedy algorithm.

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

The coin change problem, where the goal is to make change for a given amount using the fewest coins possible.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the knapsack problem, and which algorithm types can solve it?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

The knapsack problem involves selecting a subset of items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding a weight limit. It can be solved using dynamic programming and greedy algorithms

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the time complexity of the 0/1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight capacity

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the main characteristic of problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

They exhibit the greedy-choice property, meaning a global optimum can be arrived at by selecting the local optimum at each step

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the activity selection problem?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

The activity selection problem involves selecting the maximum number of activities that donâ€™t overlap, given their start and end times

### --question--

#### --text--

How does the greedy algorithm solve the activity selection problem?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

By always selecting the next activity that finishes the earliest

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the time complexity of the greedy algorithm for the activity selection problem?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

O(n log n), due to the need to sort the activities by their finish times

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the difference between fractional and 0/1 knapsack problems?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

In the fractional knapsack problem, you can take fractions of items, while in the 0/1 knapsack problem, you must take whole items or none at all

### --question--

#### --text--

How can you compute the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

Use an array to store the Fibonacci numbers up to n. Initialize the first two numbers, then use a loop to fill in the rest based on the formula ( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) )

### --question--

#### --text--

How can you maximize the profit obtained by cutting a rod into pieces of given lengths and prices? 

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

Use an array to store the maximum profit for each length of the rod. Update the array by considering each possible cut and the profit obtained from the remaining length

### --question--

#### --text--

How do you partition a string into the minimum number of palindromic substrings? 

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

Use a 2D array to store whether substrings are palindromes and an array to store the minimum cuts needed. Update the arrays based on the palindromic status of substrings and the cuts needed for the remaining string

### --question--

#### --text--

How do you find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

Use a variable to store the maximum sum ending at the current position and update it based on the previous maximum sum and the current element

### --question--

#### --text--

How do you determine if a string can be segmented into a sequence of dictionary words?

#### --distractors--

Placeholder distractor 1

---

Placeholder distractor 2

---

Placeholder distractor 3

#### --answer--

Use an array to store whether substrings can be segmented and update it based on the presence of dictionary words in the substring
