#### --distractors--

The smallest element is chosen as the pivot.  

---  

The middle element is always chosen as the pivot.  

---

#### --distractors--

Merging two sorted halves.  

---  

Swapping every adjacent pair of elements.  

---

#### --answer--

Switch to Insertion Sort for small arrays.

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens if Quick Sort is applied to an array with all identical elements?

#### --distractors--

The algorithm will sort the array in O(n^2) time.  

---  

The algorithm will fail because no pivot can be chosen.  

---  

The algorithm will skip partitioning and sort directly.

#### --answer--

Quick Sort will still work, but it may not provide optimal performance, resulting in O(n^2) time complexity.
