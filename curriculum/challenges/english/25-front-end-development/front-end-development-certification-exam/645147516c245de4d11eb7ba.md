# --description--

Welcome to the **Front End Development Certification Exam**! This exam is designed to test your knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks like React. The exam consists of multiple coding challenges that you must complete to demonstrate your ability in front-end web development.

Here are some important rules:

- You will need to complete each challenge as per the instructions.
- Ensure your code passes the provided test cases.
- You can use external libraries as needed, but the core of your solution should be written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Make sure your code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.

# --instructions--

You will be provided with a series of front-end development tasks. Each task is a standalone coding challenge and must be completed according to the given requirements.

## Tasks:

### Task 1: Create a Responsive Web Page

- Create a responsive web page using HTML and CSS.
- The page should include a header, main content section, and footer.
- The layout should adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- Use flexbox or CSS Grid for layout, and ensure accessibility best practices are followed.

### Task 2: Build a To-Do List App with JavaScript

- Build a simple to-do list app where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
- The to-do list should be stored in local storage so that the list persists when the page is refreshed.

### Task 3: Create a Calculator App with React

- Build a simple calculator app using React.
- The app should allow basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The app should have a clean, user-friendly UI and handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero).
  
### Task 4: Fetch Data from an API

- Fetch data from a public API and display it on the page.
- Use JavaScript's `fetch` method or a library like Axios.
- The data should be presented in a visually appealing format, and there should be error handling in case the API request fails.

### Task 5: Build a Form with Validation

- Create a form that collects user information (name, email, password).
- Use JavaScript to validate the form fields (e.g., email format, password strength).
- Display appropriate error messages if validation fails, and ensure that the form is submitted only if all fields are valid.

### Task 6: Implement a CSS Animation

- Create a webpage that includes a CSS animation.
- The animation should be triggered on a specific user action (e.g., clicking a button or hovering over an element).
- The animation should be smooth and should enhance the user experience.

### Task 7: Optimize a Web Page for Performance

- Given an existing web page, optimize it for performance.
- Focus on reducing the page load time by minimizing CSS and JavaScript, optimizing images, and using lazy loading.
- You can use any tools or libraries needed to achieve performance improvements.

### Task 8: Build a Navigation Menu

- Build a responsive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The menu should collapse into a "hamburger" icon on smaller screens.
- The menu should include at least three links, and when the user clicks on a link, the corresponding section should smoothly scroll into view.

# --hints--

- For the responsive web page, you can use `@media` queries to apply different styles for different screen sizes.
- In the to-do list app, you can use `localStorage.setItem()` and `localStorage.getItem()` to store and retrieve tasks.
- In React, you can manage the calculator state using the `useState` hook.
- For the form validation, you can use regular expressions to validate the email and password fields.
