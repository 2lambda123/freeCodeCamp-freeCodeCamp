By increasing the maximum call stack size.

---

By using iterative solutions or tail recursion.

---

By adding more base cases.

#### --answer--

By using iterative solutions or tail recursion.

### --question--

---

The parameters, local variables, and return address of the function.

---

The global variables used in the program.

#### --answer--

The parameters, local variables, and return address of the function.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is a tail call in recursion?

#### --distractors--

A function call that is made after all recursive calls have completed.

---

A recursive call that is the last action in a function.

---
