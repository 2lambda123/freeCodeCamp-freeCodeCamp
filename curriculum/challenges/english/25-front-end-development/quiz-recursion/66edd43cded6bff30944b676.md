## Quiz 1

### Question 1
**What is the time complexity of a recursive function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence using naive recursion?**

- O(n)
- O(2^n)  *(Correct Answer)*
- O(n log n)

---

### Question 2
**Which of the following statements about recursion is true?**

- Recursion can be replaced with iteration without changing the functionality. *(Correct Answer)*
- Recursive functions always have a base case.
- Recursion is only useful for problems with multiple solutions.

---

### Question 3
**What happens when a recursive function does not have a base case?**

- It will execute correctly.
- It will throw a stack overflow error. *(Correct Answer)*
- It will terminate after a certain number of iterations.

---

### Question 4
**In a recursive function, what is the purpose of the base case?**

- To ensure the function runs indefinitely.
- To prevent stack overflow by providing a stopping condition. *(Correct Answer)*
- To optimize the performance of the recursion.

---

### Question 5
**What is the main disadvantage of using recursion in programming?**

- It makes the code harder to understand.
- It uses more memory due to the call stack. *(Correct Answer)*
- It is slower than iterative solutions.

## Quiz 2

### Question 6
**What is a base case in recursion?**

- The final return statement of a recursive function.
- A condition that stops recursion from continuing. *(Correct Answer)*
- The input data used by the recursive function.

---

### Question 7
**In a recursive function, how can you define a base case for a factorial function?**

- If n is less than or equal to 0.
- If n is equal to 1. *(Correct Answer)*
- If n is a negative number.

---

### Question 8
**Which of the following is a common example of a base case in recursive algorithms?**

- The condition where the input is negative.
- The condition where the input is zero or one. *(Correct Answer)*
- The condition where the function is called with a larger input.

---

### Question 9
**How do you identify the base case in a recursive algorithm?**

- By analyzing the problem and determining when it can be solved without recursion. *(Correct Answer)*
- By counting the number of recursive calls.
- By measuring the execution time.

---

### Question 10
**What is the importance of defining base cases in recursive functions?**

- To make the function more complex.
- To ensure that the function can handle all input values.
- To prevent infinite recursion. *(Correct Answer)*

---

## Quiz 3

### Question 11
**What is the call stack in programming?**

- A data structure used to keep track of active subroutines in a program. *(Correct Answer)*
- A type of recursion that does not use a base case.
- A list of function calls that have been completed.

---

### Question 12
**How does the call stack behave when a recursive function is called?**

- It clears all previous function calls.
- It adds a new frame for each function call. *(Correct Answer)*
- It limits the number of recursive calls allowed.

---

### Question 13
**What will happen if the call stack exceeds its limit due to deep recursion?**

- The program will return a normal value.
- A stack overflow error will occur. *(Correct Answer)*
- The program will automatically reduce recursion depth.

---

### Question 14
**How can you avoid stack overflow errors in recursive functions?**

- By increasing the maximum call stack size.
- By using iterative solutions or tail recursion. *(Correct Answer)*
- By adding more base cases.

---

### Question 15
**What information does each frame in the call stack store?**

- Only the final return value.
- The parameters, local variables, and return address of the function. *(Correct Answer)*
- The global variables used in the program.

---

## Quiz 4

### Question 16
**What is a tail call in recursion?**

- A function call that is made after all recursive calls have completed.
- A recursive call that is the last action in a function. *(Correct Answer)*
- A call to a function that is not recursive.

---

### Question 17
**What advantage does tail call optimization provide?**

- It reduces the overall complexity of the algorithm.
- It allows recursive functions to execute without growing the call stack. *(Correct Answer)*
- It improves the readability of the code.

---

### Question 18
**How does head recursion differ from tail recursion?**

- Head recursion returns values before making the recursive call. *(Correct Answer)*
- Tail recursion is less efficient than head recursion.
- They are the same concept with different names.

---

### Question 19
**In which scenario is tail recursion particularly beneficial?**

- When dealing with large datasets that require multiple recursive calls.
- When the recursion depth is limited.
- When the programming language supports tail call optimization. *(Correct Answer)*

---

### Question 20
**How can you transform a regular recursive function into a tail-recursive function?**

- By adding more parameters to the function.
- By ensuring that the recursive call is the last operation in the function. *(Correct Answer)*
- By removing all base cases.
