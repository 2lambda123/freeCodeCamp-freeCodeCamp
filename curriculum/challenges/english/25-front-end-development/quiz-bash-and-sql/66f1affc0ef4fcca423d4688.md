### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is an example of why it is important to know when to use fixed-length and when to use variable-length data types in SQL?

#### --distractors--

To hold a list of telephone numbers since, in most systems, telephone numbers are either strictly character or numeric and therefore have a fixed length.

---

To hold product prices since price is generally held as a numeric or monetary value.

---

#### --answer--

### --question--

#### --text--

If a database designer mistakenly chooses `INTEGER` as the data type to hold customer loyalty points when in fact the points may include fractional values, most probably, what happens?

#### --distractors--

The database will deny accepting any insert operation when there are points with fractional values to avoid any inaccuracies in the system.

---

SQL will change the data type automatically to DECIMAL or FLOAT to accommodate the fractional values.

---

The database will store the fractional points in text strings form. Storage space increases with complication in calculations.

#### --answer--

The fractional part of the points will be truncated, leading to a loss of data accuracy and potentially causing customer dissatisfaction.
