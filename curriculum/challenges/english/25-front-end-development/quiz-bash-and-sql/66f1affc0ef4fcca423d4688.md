#### --answer--

SQL is a specialized language for managing data in relational databases, while languages like Python or Java have a broader range of applications.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of these statements best describes the fundamental nature and purpose of SQL?

#### --distractors--

SQL is a procedural programming language designed specifically for building an interactive Web application but it relies heavily on database interaction to generate dynamic content.

---

SQL is a programming language that allows developers direct access to a computer's hardware in order to maximize the efficiency at which data is stored and retrieved from the database.

---

SQL is a markup language that marks, format, and structures data for presentation on a web page such that they would be viewable through any web browser.

#### --answer--

SQL is a query language used to retrieve specific information from data tables within a relational database management system.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is an example of why it is important to know when to use fixed-length and when to use variable-length data types in SQL?

#### --distractors--

To hold a list of telephone numbers since, in most systems, telephone numbers are either strictly character or numeric and therefore have a fixed length.

---

To hold product prices since price is generally held as a numeric or monetary value.

---

To hold dates of birth, since each date follows the same format.

#### --answer--

To hold customer reviews: The length of review may vary to a great extent.

### --question--

#### --text--

If a database designer mistakenly chooses `INTEGER` as the data type to hold customer loyalty points when in fact the points may include fractional values, most probably, what happens?

#### --distractors--

The database will deny accepting any insert operation when there are points with fractional values to avoid any inaccuracies in the system.

---

SQL will change the data type automatically to DECIMAL or FLOAT to accommodate the fractional values.

---

The database will store the fractional points in text strings form. Storage space increases with complication in calculations.

#### --answer--

The fractional part of the points will be truncated, leading to a loss of data accuracy and potentially causing customer dissatisfaction.

You are working on a Linux system and need to write a bash script that performs these tasks:
1. List all files and folders, including hidden ones, within the "/home/user" directory.
2. Copy all ".txt" files from the "/home/user" directory to a folder named "text_backup" within the current directory.
3. Delete all files with the ".tmp" extension in the "/home/user" directory, asking for confirmation before deleting each file.

#### --distractors--

```
ls -a /home/user
cp *.txt text_backup/
rm -i *.tmp
```

---

```
ls -a /home/user
cp *.txt /home/user/text_backup/
rm -rf /home/user/*.tmp
```

---

```
ls -a /home/user
cp /home/user/*.txt /home/user/text_backup/
rm -i *.tmp
```


#### --answer--

You are designing a database for a music store. You need to keep track of albums and their artists. You have two tables:

**Table: Albums**

| Column Name | Data Type  | Constraints |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| AlbumID     | INT        | PRIMARY KEY |
| AlbumTitle   | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL   |
| ReleaseYear  | INT        |             |

**Table: Artists**

| Column Name | Data Type  | Constraints |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| ArtistID    | INT        | PRIMARY KEY |
| ArtistName  | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL   |

You need to ensure that each album is associated with the correct artist.  

**Question:** What is the best way to represent the relationship between the Albums table and Artists table, given that an artist can have multiple albums? 


#### --distractors--

Add a column named `ArtistName` to the Albums table.

---

Add a column named `AlbumTitle` to the Artists table.

---

Create a new table called `AlbumsArtists` with both `AlbumID` and `ArtistID`  as foreign keys.

#### --answer--
