```js
new RegExp("hello, world!")
```

---

```js
/(?:^|\s)hello[,]?\sworld[!]?(?:$|\s)/i
```

#### --answer--

```js
"hello, world!"
```

### --question--

#### --text--

Which `RegExp` contains the same pattern as the regular expression literal:

```js
/f[o0]{2} b[a4@]r/i
```

#### --distractors--

```js
new RegExp("/f[o0]{2} b[a4@]r/", "i")
```

---

```js
new RegExp("f[o0]{2} b[a4@]r", "g")
```

---

```js
new RegExp("f[o0]{2} b[a4@]r")
```

#### --answer--

```js
new RegExp("f[o0]{2} b[a4@]r", "i")
```

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the return type for the regular expression method `test`?

#### --distractors--

An `Array` of `String`s that matched the regular expression.

---

An `Object` containing information about the (sub)string the regular expression matched.

---

`null`, the method `test` only validates if the given regular expression is valid.

#### --answer--

A `boolean` indicating whether the string matches the regular expression.

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when `match` is used?

#### --distractors--

`match` searches for any strings that match the given regular expression, and returns ALL matches as an `Array`.

---

`match` searches for the first full match, and returns the starting index of that match.

---

`match` searches for the first full match, and returns a `boolean` indicating whether or not a match was found.

#### --answer--

`match` searches for the first full match, and returns an `Array` containing that first match.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which is the best use case for `test`?

#### --distractors--

`test` should be used for verifying a given regular expression.

---

`test` should be used for detailed information about a string match, such as the length of the matched `String`.

---

`test` should be used to extract all matches from a given `String`.

#### --answer--

`test` should be used to check if a given `String` matches the regular expression.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the purpose of using `replace`?

#### --distractors--

`replace` is used to replace the current regular expression with a new regular expression.

---

When given an index and a `String`, `replace` replaces the character at the specified index with the `String` provided.

---

`replace` is a helper method for replacing an entire `String` with another `String`.

#### --answer--

`replace` replaces a matched string with a given replacement `String`.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the difference between `match` and `matchAll`?

#### --distractors--

`match` is restricted to only one match, while `matchAll` captures all possible matches.

---

`match` returns a `boolean` indicating whether a match is found, while `matchAll` returns a `Number` representing the amount of matches found.

---

`match` returns a `Number` indicating the starting index of the first match found, while `matchAll` returns an `Array` of `Number`s containing indices where a match was found.

#### --answer--

`match` returns an `Array` of `String`s that match, while `matchAll` returns an iterator `Object` of all matches found.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is the correct use of `replaceAll`?

#### --distractors--

```js
foo.replaceAll(/foobar/, "fizzbuzz")
```

---

```js
foo.replaceAll(/foobar/i, "fizzbuzz")
```

---

```js
foo.replaceAll(/foobar/gi, /fizzbuzz/)
```

#### --answer--

```js
foo.replaceAll(/foobar/g, "fizzbuzz")
```

### --question--

#### --text--

#### --distractors--

`\w`

---

`\s`

---

`\D`

#### --answer--

`\d`

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when a lookahead `(?=)` is used in a regular expression?

#### --distractors--

The lookahead will assert to the left of the string, verifying that the sub-pattern IS present.

---

A lookahead is an alternate regular expression pattern used when the main pattern fails to match.

---

The lookahead will assert to the right of the string, verifying that the sub-pattern IS NOT present.

#### --answer--

A lookahead asserts to the right of the String, verifying that the sub-pattern IS present.

### --question--

#### --text--

When making a regular expression, where should a lookbehind `(?<=)` be placed?

#### --distractors--

The lookbehind can be placed anywhere in the regular expression.

---

The lookbehind should be placed to the right of the main pattern of the regular expression.

---

The lookbehind should include the main pattern of the regular expression.

#### --answer--

The lookbehind should be placed to the left of the main pattern of the regular expression.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which quantifier matches between 0 and 1 of a pattern?

#### --distractors--

`+`

---

`*`

---

`a{0,}`

#### --answer--

---

#### --answer--

`/^\d{1,6}$/`

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when a capturing group `(...)` is used in a regular expression?

#### --distractors--

The capturing group is immediately evaluated, regardless of where it is located in the regular expression.

---

The capturing group attempts to match using the given subpattern, and continues without memorizing the result.

---

The capturing group is a prioritized subpattern, which will immediately return when a match is found for the subpattern.

#### --answer--

The capturing group attempts to match using the given subpattern, and continues with the result in memory.

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when a non-capturing group `(?:...)` is used in a regular expression?

#### --distractors--

The non-capturing group attempts to match using the given subpattern, and continues with the result in memory.

---

The non-capturing group immediately terminates when it finds a match for the given subpattern.

---

The non-capturing group is considered an optional match, so only a successful match is added on the result.

#### --answer--

The non-capturing group attempts to match using the given subpattern, and continues without memorizing the result.
