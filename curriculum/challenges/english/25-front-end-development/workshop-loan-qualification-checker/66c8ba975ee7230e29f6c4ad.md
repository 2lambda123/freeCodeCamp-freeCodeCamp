# --description--

To check which loan a user is qualified for based on the `annualIncome` and `creditScore` they entered, you have to use `if/else if` statement, AKA conditonals.

Here's the basic syntax of an `if/else if` statement:

```js
if (condition1) {
  // Do something if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Do something if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // Do something if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```

And here is an example:

```js
let number = 10;

if (number > 20) {
  console.log("The number is greater than 20");
} else if (number > 10) {
  console.log("The number is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20");
} else {
  console.log("The number is 10 or less");
}
```
