# --description--

To check which loan a user is qualified for based on the `annualIncome` and `creditScore` they entered, you have to use `if/else if` statement, AKA conditonals.

Starting with the duplex loan, create an `if` statement that checks if `annualIncome` is greater than or equal to `minIncomeForDuplex` AND if `creditScore` is greater than `minCreditScoreForDuplex`.

Inside the `if` statement, reassign the `loanMessage` to `"You're qualified for a duplex loan, car loan, and condo loan"`, then log the `loanMessage` variable to the console.

const minCreditScoreForCar = 650;
