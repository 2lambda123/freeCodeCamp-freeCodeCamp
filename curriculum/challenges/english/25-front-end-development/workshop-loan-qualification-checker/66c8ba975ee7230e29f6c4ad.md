# --description--

To check which loan a user is qualified for based on the `annualIncome` and `creditScore` they entered, you have to use `if/else if` statement, AKA conditonals.

Here's the basic syntax of an `if/else if` statement:

```js
if (condition1) {
  // Do something if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Do something else if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // Do something else if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```

You can also combine conditions inside a single `if` statement with the `AND` and `OR` operator like this:

```js
if (condition1 && condition2) {
  // Do something if both conditions are true
}

if (condition1 || condition2) {
  // Do something if either condition1 or condition2 is true
}
```

Starting with the duplex loan, create an empty `if` statement that checks if `annualIncome` is greater than or equal to `minIncomeForDuplex` AND if `creditScore` is greater than `minCreditScoreForDuplex`.

const minCreditScoreForCar = 650;

const minIncomeForCondo = 45000;
const minCreditScoreForCondo = 680;
