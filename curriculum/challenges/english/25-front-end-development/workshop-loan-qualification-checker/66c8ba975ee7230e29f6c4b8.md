# --description--

Use `const` to create a `finalMessage` variable and set it to \` `Your credit score is ${creditScore} and your annual income is ${annualIncome}. So, ${qualificationMessage}` \`.

Feel free to use the plus operator for the concatenation if you want to.

After that, log the `finalMessage` variable to the console to see what it looks like.
