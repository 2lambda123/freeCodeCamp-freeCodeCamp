# --description--

You will now construct a better message that displays the loans the applicant is elegible for. Before that, you have to remove the existing messages inside the `if` and `else if` blocks.

Change the `loanMessage` inside the first condition to `"- Duplex loan\n- Car loan\n- Condo loan\n"` and remove the console log statement.

const minIncomeForCar = 30000;
const minCreditScoreForCar = 650;

const minIncomeForCondo = 45000;
const minCreditScoreForCondo = 680;

let loanMessage = '';
