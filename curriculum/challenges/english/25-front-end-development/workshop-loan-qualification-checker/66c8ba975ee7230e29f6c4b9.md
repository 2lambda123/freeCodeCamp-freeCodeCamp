const minIncomeForDuplex = 60000;
const minCreditScoreForDuplex = 700;

const minIncomeForCar = 30000;

const minIncomeForCondo = 45000;
const minCreditScoreForCondo = 680;

let loanMessage = '';

  annualIncome >= minIncomeForDuplex &&
  creditScore >= minCreditScoreForDuplex

}

let qualificationMessage =
  'You qualify for the following loan(s):\n \n' + loanMessage;

const finalMessage = `Your credit score is ${creditScore} and your annual income is ${annualIncome}. So, ${qualificationMessage}`;
console.log(finalMessage);
