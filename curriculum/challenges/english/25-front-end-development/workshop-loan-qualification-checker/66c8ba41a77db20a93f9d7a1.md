# --description--

In this workshop, you'll learn JavaScript conditionals by building a loan qualification checker app.

The app will check whether the user is eligible for a duplex, car, and condo loan.

The first thing you need to do is to ask the user for the annual income and credit score. For this, you'll have to use the `prompt()` function.

Use `const` to create an `annualIncome` and `creditScore` variables. Set them both to a prompt with the string `Enter your annual income:'` and `Enter your credit score:` respectively.
