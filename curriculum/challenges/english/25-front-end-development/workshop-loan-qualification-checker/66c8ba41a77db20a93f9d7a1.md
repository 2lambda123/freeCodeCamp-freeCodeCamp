# --description--

In this workshop, you'll review JavaScript conditionals by building a loan qualification checker app.

The app will check whether the user is eligible for a duplex, car, and condo loan based on their annual income and credit score.

Use `let` to create an `annualIncome` and `creditScore` variables. Set them to `55000` and `650` respectively.

You will reassign these two variables later to test eligibility for loans based on different annual income and credit score values. That's why you're using `let` to declare both variables.
