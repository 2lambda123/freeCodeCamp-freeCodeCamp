# --description--

In this workshop, you'll learn JavaScript conditionals by building a loan qualification checker app.

The app will check whether the user is eligible for a duplex, car, and condo loan.

The first thing you need to do is to ask the user for the annual income and credit score. For this, you'll have to use the `prompt()` function.

Use `let` to create an `annualIncome` and `creditScore` variables. Set them to `55000` and `650` respectively.
