# --description--

If you change the `annualIncome` and `creditScore` variables to fall below the minimum required all the loans, you would see a message that looks like this:

> Your credit score is 50 and your annual income is 3000. So, You qualify for the following loan(s):

This means you need to account for a situation in which the applicant qualifies for no loans.

To do this, create an `if` statement with the condition `"qualificationMessage === 'You qualify for the following loan(s):\n \n"`.

If this condition is true, it means the applicant doesn't qualify for any loan. So, in the block of the `if` statement, set the `qualificationMessage` to `"You do not qualify for any loans"`.

With that, you've completed the loan qualification checker project!
