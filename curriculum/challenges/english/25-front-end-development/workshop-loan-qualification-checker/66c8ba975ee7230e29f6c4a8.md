# --description--

You want to make sure the numbers entered by the user for both `annualIncome` and `creditScore` are indeed numbers. You should also handle a situation in which the user enters a decimal point number.

To do that, you have to wrap the `parseFloat()` function around the `prompt()` function.

# --hints--

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
const annualIncome = prompt('Enter your annual income:');
const creditScore = prompt('Enter your credit score:');
