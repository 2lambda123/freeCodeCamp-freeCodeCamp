# --description--

Create an object named `recipe1`. Inside that `recipe1` object, create a `"name"` property with the value `"Spaghetti Carbonara"`.

Also inside the `recipe1` object, create an `"ingredients"` key with an array as the value. The array should have `"spaghetti"`, `"Parmesan cheese"`, `"pancetta"`, and `"black pepper"` inside it.

Other properties and values the `recipe1` object should have are:

| Key | Value   |
| ----------- | ------- |
| `"cookingTime"`       | `22` |
| `"totalIngredients"`   | `null`   |
| `"difficultyLevel"`   | `''`   |
| `"ratings"`    | `[4, 5, 4, 5]`   |
| `"averageRating"`   | `null`   |

The properties with `null` and empty array values will have items pushed into them later after you calculate them.
