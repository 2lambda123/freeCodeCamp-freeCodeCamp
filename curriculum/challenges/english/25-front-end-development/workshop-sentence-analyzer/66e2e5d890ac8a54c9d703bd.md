# --description--

It's time to write the logic for analyzing the `sentence`. For this, you'll use a loop.

Loops let you automate repetitive tasks by executing the same block of code multiple times. There are `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...in`, and `for...of` loops.

A `for` loop is good enough to analyze the `sentence`. Here's the basic syntax of the `for` loop:

```js
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code to run
}
```

And here's an example that runs 5 times based on the `condition` specified:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);  // Logs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in their respective lines
}
```

Create a for loop with `i` as the initializer, `i < sentence.length`, and `i++` as the incrementer. Leave the block empty for now.

const vowels = "aeiou";

const punctuations = '.,!?;:-()[]{}"\'â€“';
