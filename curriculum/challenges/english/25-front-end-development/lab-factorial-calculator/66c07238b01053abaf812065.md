# --description--

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab. 

**User Stories:**

1. You should ask the user for a number using a prompt window and store the number in a variable called `inputNumber`.
   
2. Declare a variable `result` and assign it the value of `1`.
   
3. Using a for loop, you should loop through all numbers from `1` to `inputNumber` (inclusive) and for each number, multiply the `result` variable by the current number and assign the result to the `result` variable.
   
4. You should log the result of the factorial of `inputNumber` to the console. The output should be in the format `The factorial of [inputNumber] is [result]`.

# --hints--

Your `link` element should be within your `head` element.

# --solutions--

```js
let inputNumber = prompt("Enter a number: ");
let result = 1;
for (let i = 1; i <= inputNumber; i++) {
  result *= i;
}

console.log(`Factorial of ${inputNumber} is: ${result}`); 
```
