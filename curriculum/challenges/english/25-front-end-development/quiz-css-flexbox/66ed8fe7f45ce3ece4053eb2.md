## --quiz--

### --question--

#### --text--

Which `justify-content` value ensures that the first flex item aligns to the start of the main axis, the last flex item aligns to the end, and all remaining items are evenly distributed with equal space between them?

#### --distractors--

`space-evenly`

---

`space-around`

---

`center`

#### --answer--

`space-between`

### --question--

#### --text--

When both `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` are set to `1` on all flex items, how is the space distributed if the container is resized to be smaller than the total size of the items?

#### --distractors--

Items will grow and shrink in proportion to their `flex-basis`.

---

Items will shrink equally regardless of size.

---

Items will not shrink, only grow.

#### --answer--

Items will shrink proportionally based on their `flex-shrink` value relative to others.

### --question--

#### --text--

How does setting `flex-basis: auto` differ from setting `flex-basis: 0`?

#### --distractors--

`flex-basis: auto` prevents the items from growing.

---

`flex-basis: 0` forces the items to wrap.

---

There is no difference; both set the item's base size to its minimum content.

#### --answer--

`flex-basis: auto` uses the item's content size or width, while `flex-basis: 0` ignores content size and allows the item to grow or shrink based on available space.

### --question--

#### --text--

What effect does setting `align-content: space-between` have when there is only one line of flex items in a container?

#### --distractors--

It will stretch the single line to take up available vertical space.

---

It will align the items at the start of the cross axis.

---

It will evenly distribute items along the cross axis.

#### --answer--

It has no effect because `align-content` applies only when there are multiple lines of items.

### --question--

#### --text--

When using Flexbox, which combination of properties will cause a flex container to reverse the main axis and wrap the items starting from the bottom?

#### --distractors--

`flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` and `align-items: flex-end`

---

`flex-direction: row-reverse` and `justify-content: space-between`

---

`flex-direction: row` and `flex-wrap: wrap`

#### --answer--

`flex-direction: column-reverse` and `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse`

### --question--

#### --text--

If a flex container has `flex-wrap: wrap`, and the items are set with `align-self: baseline`, what is the result?

#### --distractors--

All items will align to the top of the container.

---

The items will ignore wrapping and stay in a single line.

---

The items will align to the baseline of the last line.

#### --answer--

Each line of flex items will align according to the baseline of the tallest item in that line.

### --question--

#### --text--

How does Flexbox handle alignment along the cross axis when `align-items` is set to `stretch` and the item's height is set explicitly?

#### --distractors--

The item's height will override the `stretch` value.

---

The items will align to the top of the container.

---

The items will shrink to their minimum height.

#### --answer--

The itemâ€™s explicit height will override the `stretch` behavior, preventing it from stretching.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following `flex-basis` values takes precedence over the `width` property in determining the size of a flex item?

#### --distractors--

`auto`

---

`initial`

---

`max-content`

#### --answer--

`flex-basis`

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the impact of setting `align-content: stretch` when the total height of the flex items is smaller than the container?

#### --distractors--

It will center the flex lines vertically within the container.

---

It will create equal space between flex items.

---

It will align the flex lines at the bottom of the container.

#### --answer--

The flex lines will stretch to fill the remaining vertical space of the container.

### --question--

#### --text--

In a Flexbox container with `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` and `align-items: flex-end`, what is the result?

#### --distractors--

Flex items will stack starting from the top.

---

Flex items will shrink to the end of each line.

---

Items will align to the start of the container.

#### --answer--

Flex items will wrap in reverse order and align to the end of the cross axis.

### --question--

#### --text--

When using `order` to manipulate the position of a flex item, what impact does this have on the DOM structure?

#### --distractors--

The order affects both the DOM and visual structure.

---

The DOM structure is rearranged to match the visual order.

---

It permanently changes the position of the item in the DOM.

#### --answer--

The DOM structure remains unchanged; only the visual order is affected.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which property combination would distribute flex items evenly with equal space around them while ensuring that the first and last item stay within the container's bounds?

#### --distractors--

`justify-content: space-between` and `align-items: center`

---

`justify-content: center` and `align-items: stretch`

---

`flex-wrap: wrap` and `align-content: flex-start`

#### --answer--

`justify-content: space-around` and `align-items: stretch`

### --question--

#### --text--

If a flex container is set with `flex-direction: row-reverse` and `justify-content: flex-start`, where will the first item appear?

#### --distractors--

At the start of the container.

---

In the center of the container.

---

After all other items.

#### --answer--

At the right side of the container.

### --question--

#### --text--

How can you align a flex item to the center of its container along both the main and cross axes?

#### --distractors--

Set `align-items: flex-start` and `justify-content: flex-end`.

---

Set `align-content: center` and `justify-content: flex-start`.

---

Set `align-items: baseline` and `justify-content: space-around`.

#### --answer--

Set `align-items: center` and `justify-content: center`.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the behavior of a flex container when `flex-grow: 2` is applied to one item and `flex-grow: 1` is applied to another?

#### --distractors--

Both items will grow at the same rate to fill available space.

---

The item with `flex-grow: 1` will take up twice the space.

---

Both items will shrink equally to fit into the container.

#### --answer--

The item with `flex-grow: 2` will take up twice as much available space as the item with `flex-grow: 1`.

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when `align-items` is set to `baseline`?

#### --distractors--

Items align to the top of the container.

---

Items align to the bottom of the container.

---

Items align to the start of the main axis.

#### --answer--

Items align along their text baselines on the cross axis.

### --question--

#### --text--

If `align-items` is set to `stretch` but a flex item has an explicit width, what will happen?

#### --distractors--

The flex item will stretch to fill the container.

---

The `stretch` value will be ignored, and the item will keep its explicit width.

---

The item's height will be affected but not its width.

#### --answer--

The explicit width of the flex item will prevent it from stretching.

### --question--

#### --text--

How does `flex-basis: 100%` interact with `flex-wrap: wrap`?

#### --distractors--

The flex items will shrink to fit into one row.

---

Flex items will stack on top of each other vertically.

---

The items will ignore wrapping and stay in a single line.

#### --answer--

Each flex item will take up the full width of the container and wrap onto a new line.

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when you set both `flex-grow: 1` and `flex-basis: 50%` on a flex item?

#### --distractors--

The flex item will shrink to 50% of its container.

---

The flex item will grow beyond 50% to fill available space.

---

The flex item will ignore its `flex-basis` and grow equally with other items.

#### --answer--

The flex item will start with a base size of 50% and grow to fill available space if needed.

### --question--

#### --text--

If a flex container is set to `flex-direction: column-reverse` and `align-items: center`, how will the flex items be positioned in the container?

#### --distractors--

The flex items will stack from top to bottom and be aligned to the center of the cross axis.

---

The flex items will stack from bottom to top and be aligned to the start of the container.

---

The flex items will stack from top to bottom and be aligned to the start of the main axis.

#### --answer--

The flex items will stack from bottom to top and be aligned to the center of the cross axis.
