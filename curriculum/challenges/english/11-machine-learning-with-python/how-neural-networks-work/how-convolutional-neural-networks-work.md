# --questions--

## --text--

When are Convolutional Neural Networks not useful?

## --answers--

If your data can't be made to look like an image, or if you can rearrange elements of your data and it's still just as useful.

---

If your data is made up of different 2D or 3D images.

---

If your data is text or sound based.
