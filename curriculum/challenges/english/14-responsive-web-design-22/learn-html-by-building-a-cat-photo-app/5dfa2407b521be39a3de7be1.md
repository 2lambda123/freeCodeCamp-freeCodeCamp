# --description--

To enhance the user experience, you will now turn the text "cute cats" into a clickable link that directs users to a different picture. You will achieve this by wrapping the text "cute cats" in an anchor (`a`) element with the appropriate `href` attribute pointing to the desired image URL.

Hereâ€™s the basic syntax for creating a link:

```html
<a href="URL">text</a>
```

In this case, the URL should be set to the address of the picture you want to link to, such as `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cute-cat.jpg`.

# --hints--

Your `p` element should have a nested anchor (`a`) element with the text `cat photos`. You may have deleted it or have a typo.

```js
const anchor = document.querySelectorAll('p > a');
assert(
  anchor.length &&
    anchor[0].innerText.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, ' ') === 'cat photos'
);
```

Your anchor (`a`) element does not have a `target` attribute. Check that there is a space after the opening tag's name and/or there are spaces before all attribute names.

```js
assert(document.querySelector('a').hasAttribute('target'));
```

The value of the `target` attribute should be `_blank`. You have either omitted the value or have a typo. Remember that attribute values should be surrounded with quotation marks.

```js
assert(document.querySelector('a').getAttribute('target') === '_blank');
```
