In the courses of web development you have divided into different parts as different projects also as different levels but users are directly allowed to go to last level which makes them see the next steps easily by going to the next levels of their process so if we lock the levels and release them one by one so the user will learn something really without just working for the certification and can build skills,knowledge and make his projects on his own and will be very useful for him.
