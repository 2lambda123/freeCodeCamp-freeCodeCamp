### PHP Syntax

The structure of a PHP syntax somewhat looks like:

```php
    <?php
    // Your PHP code goes here.
    ?>
```
This PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.
A PHP file generally have HTML tags, and some scripting code .
The default file extension for PHP files is `.php`.

 ### How do you write comments in PHP?

A comment in PHP code is a line that is not read/executed as part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.

In PHP, comments can be made in two ways. Comments can be single-line comments, or multi-line comments:

```php
<?php
   // This is a single-line comment

    # This is also a single-line comment

   /*
     This is a multiple-line comment block
     that spans over multiple
     lines
   */
?>
```
