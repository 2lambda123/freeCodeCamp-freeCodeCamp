## Loops

Loops are used in PHP to perform repeated tasks based on a condition.

Conditions typically return `true` or `false` when analysed.

A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns `false`.

You can type `php for` , `php while` or `php do while` to get more info on any of these.

PHP has the following types of loop statements :
- `for` - loop through a block of code with specific number of times.
- `while` - loop through a block of code if condition is true.
- `do...while` - loop through a block of code one and continue loop if condition is true.
- `foreach` - loop through a block of code for each value within an array.

Using a `break` within the loop can stop the loop execution.
