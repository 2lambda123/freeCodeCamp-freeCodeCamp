## PHP Operators
PHP contains similar operators to other programming languages.

A single “=” is used as the assignment operator and a double “==” or triple “===” is used for comparison.

The usual “<” and “>” can also be used for comparison and “+=” can be used to add a value and assign it at the same time.

Most notable is the use of the “.” to concatenate strings and “.=” to append one string to the end of another.
