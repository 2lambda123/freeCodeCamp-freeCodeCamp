## Computer Hardware

In this section, we explore the various hardware components of modern computers. 

## Parts of a Personal Computer

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
A Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.

### Expansion Cards (eg. GPU)
An expansion card is an embeded circuit card which enhances the functionality of the motherboard by either adding in new capabilites or upgrading existing ones. The most common expansions cards are GPUs, graphical processing units.

### Storage (SSD and HDD)
Solid State Drives (SSD) and Hard Disk Drives (HDD) are used to store information on the computer. They retain their memory even after loss of power. Most computer have only one type of storage while higher-end computers commonly use both.

### Memory (RAM)
Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage which stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.

### Motherboard
Motherboard holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.
