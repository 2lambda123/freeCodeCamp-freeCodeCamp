## You are Ready
  
  To open the Linux environment you installed, just open the Start menu and search for whatever distribution you installed. 
  For example, if you installed Ubuntu, launch the Ubuntu shortcut.
  
  The first time you launch the Linux environment, you have to enter a UNIX username and password. 
  These don’t have to match your Windows username and password,**they are used only with the Linux environment.**
