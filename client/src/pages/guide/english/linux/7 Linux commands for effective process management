8 Linux command for effective process management:


1. Starting a process:
The easiest way to start a process is to type its name at the command line and press enter.

2. Viewing your executable path:
you can view your executable path using echo $PATH

3. WHICH:
use the WHICH command to view the pull path of executable path.

4. Keeping a process running:
A process may not continue to run when you log out or close your terminal. This can be avoided by preceding the command you want to run with nohup command.
For example, suppose you want to run myprogram.sh
nohup myprogram.sh 

5. Manage a Running Process:
Each process is given a unique process Identification number (PID)
ps -ef
we can pipe this output to grep.

6. PGREP:
The pgrep command was created to further simplify things by removing the need to call grep separately

7. Top:
The top command has been around a long time and is very useful for viewing details of running processes and quickly identifying issues such as memory hogs.
