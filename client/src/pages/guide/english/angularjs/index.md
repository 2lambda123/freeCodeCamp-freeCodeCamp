## AngularJS

AngularJS (versions 1.x) is an open source front-end JavaScript framework. AngularJS extends HTML to develop rich and powerful front-ends. 
It reduces the repetitive use of HTML code. This repetition can be avoided by using the directives provided by AngularJS which saves 
much time and effort.

```shell 
npm install angular
