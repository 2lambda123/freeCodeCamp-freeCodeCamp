## Luhn Algorithm

The Luhn algorithm, also called the Luhn formula is a simple formula used for validating credit card numbers or identification of numbers, such as Social Security numbers, IMEI numbers, etc. The algorithm was created by Hans Peter Luhn in 1960s.

### How It Works?

These are the simple steps of the algorithm:
  
  1. Start from the rightmost digit and double the value of every second digit.
  2. If doubling results in two digits(greater than 9), then sum the digits of the product, to get a single digit number.
  3. Take the sum of all the digits which comes from second step and remaining digits from step 1(non-doubled digits).
  4. If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid.
