## What is Python?

<a href='https://www.python.org' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Python</a> is a general purpose programming language which is dynamically typed, interpreted, and known for its easy readability with great design principles.

<a href='https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Python FAQ</a>.

## Python 2 or Python 3

*   The two versions are similar, with knowledge of one switching to writing code for the other is easy.
*   <a href='https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Python 2 or Python 3</a>
    *   <a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Python 2.x will not be maintained past 2020.</a> 
    * 3.x is under active development. This means that all recent standard library improvements, for example, are only available by default in Python 3.x.
    *   Python ecosystem has amassed a significant amount of quality software over the years. The downside of breaking backwards compatibility in 3.x is that some of that software (especially in-house software in companies) still doesn't work on 3.x yet.

## Installation

Most *nix based operating systems come with Python installed (usually Python 2, Python 3 in most recent ones). Replacing the system Python is not recommended and may cause problems. However, different versions of Python can be safely installed alongside the system Python. See <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Python Setup and Usage</a>.

Windows doesn't come with Python, the installer and instructions can be found <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here</a>

## Python Interpreter

The Python interpreter is what is used to run Python scripts.

If it is available and in Unix shellâ€™s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command `python` followed by the script name will invoke the interpreter and run the script.

`hello_campers.py`

```python
print('Hello campers!')
```

From terminal:

    $ python hello_campers.py
    Hello campers!

"When multiple versions of Python are installed, calling them by version is possible depending on the install configuration. In the Cloud9 ide custom environment, they can be invoked like:

    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.6
    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.4.3
    $ python3.5 --version
    Python 3.5.1
    $ python3.6 --version
    Python 3.6.2 
    $ python3.7 --version
    Python 3.7.1

## Python Interpreter Interactive Mode

Interactive mode can be started by invoking the Python interpreter with the `-i` flag or without any arguments.

Interactive mode has a prompt where Python commands can be entered and run:

    $ python3.5
    Python 3.5.1 (default, Dec 18 2015, 00:00:00)
    GCC 4.8.4 on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> print("Hello campers!")
    Hello campers!
    >>> 1 + 2
    3
    >>> exit()
    $

## The Zen of Python

Some of the principles that influenced the design of Python are included as an Easter egg and can be read by using the command inside Python interpreter interactive mode:

    >>> import this
    The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!


## Pros and Cons of Python
### Pros
1. Interactive language with a module support for almost all functionality.
2. Open Source: So, you can contribute to the community, the functions you have developed for future use and to help others
3. A lot of good interpreters and notebooks available for better experience like jupyter notebook.

#### Cons
1. Being open source, many different ways have developed over the year for same function. This sometimes, creates chaos for others to read someone else code.
2. It is a slow language. So, a very bad language to use for developing general algorithms.

## Documentation

<a href='https://docs.python.org/3/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Python is well documented</a>. These docs include tutorials, guides, references and meta information for language.

Another important reference is the Python Enhancement Proposals (<a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>PEPs</a>). Included in the PEPs is a style guide for writing Python code, <a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>`PEP 8`</a>.

## Debugging

Inline `print` statements can be used for simple debugging:

> **... often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.**
> 
> --<a href='https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Executive Summary</a>

Python also includes more powerful tools for debugging, such as:

*   logging module, <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>_logging_</a>
*   debugging module, <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>_pdb_</a>

Just note that these exist for now.

## Hello World!

Going back to the docs, we can read about the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>`print`</a> function, a <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>_built-in function_</a> of the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Python Standard Library</a>.

    print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

The built-in functions are listed in alphabetical order. The name is followed by a parenthesized list of formal parameters with optional default values. Under that is a short description of the function and its parameters are given and occasionally an example.

The <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>`print`</a> function in Python 3 replaces the <a href='https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#print' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>`print`</a> statement in Python 2.

    >>> print("Hello world!")
    Hello world!

A function is called when the name of the function is followed by `()`. For the Hello world! example, the print function is called with a string as an argument for the first parameter. For the rest of the parameters the defaults are used.

The argument that we called the `print` function with is a `str` object or _string_, one of Python's <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>_built-in types_</a>.
Also the most important thing about python is that you don't have to specify the data type while declaring a variable, python's compiler
will do that itself based on the type of value assigned.

The `objects` parameter is prefixed with a `*` which indicates that the function will take an arbitrary number of arguments for that parameter.

### Expression

Some Python expressions are similar to languages such as C and Java, while some are not:

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division and integer division. Python also added the ** operator for exponentiation.
From Python 3.5, the new @ infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.
In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c.
Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C.
Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a generator expression.
Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.
Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).
Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively "modifying the contents" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.
Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through, and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.
Python has a "string format" operator %. This functions analogous to printf format strings in C, e.g. "spam=%s eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2) evaluates to "spam=blah eggs=2". In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. "spam={0} eggs={1}".format("blah", 2). Python 3.6 added "f-strings": blah = "blah"; eggs = 2; f'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}'.
Python has various kinds of string literals:
Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as "formatted string literals".
Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby.
Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare "@-quoting" in C#.
Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.
In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:

List comprehensions vs. for-loops
Conditional expressions vs. if blocks
The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.
Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.
