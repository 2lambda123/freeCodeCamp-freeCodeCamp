## Apache

The Apache HTTP Server, commonly known as Apache, is a free and open-source cross-platform web server, released under the terms of [Apache License 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License). Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation.
Apache supports a variety of features, many implemented as compiled modules which extend the core functionality. These can range from authentication schemes to supporting server-side programming languages such as Perl, Python, Tcl and PHP. Popular authentication modules include mod_access, mod_auth, mod_digest, and mod_auth_digest, the successor to mod_digest.
