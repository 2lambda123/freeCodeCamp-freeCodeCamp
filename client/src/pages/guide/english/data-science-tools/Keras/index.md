# Keras
Keras is an open-source library maintained by Google for implementing neural networks with minimal lines of code.
It is a high level API written in Python which can use either TensorFlow, Theano or Microsoft CNTK as backend.
It has support for CPU as well as GPU enabled computation.
The library comes with all the functionalities with numerous classes for implementing a variety neural networks.
It has a robust community which actively supports its development.
Keras has shown to be effective for those who want to get started with deep learning. However, established companies are using
Keras in production.
