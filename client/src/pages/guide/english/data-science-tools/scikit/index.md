Scikit-learn is a popular machine-learning library for use in Python. Data scientists and researchers around the world use scikit-learn to build and test various models and algorithms, ranging from logistic regression to support vector machines. Additionally, scikit offers various utilities for data processing and cleaning, including train-test-split creation, PCA, and feature normalization. Finally, scikit contains functions for model selection, allowing the user to specify the outcome metric of interest and compare created models. 

Scikit-learn is open-source and commercially usable (BSD license).
