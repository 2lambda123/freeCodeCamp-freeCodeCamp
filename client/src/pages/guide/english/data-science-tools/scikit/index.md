### Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.[3] It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy 

The scikit-learn project started as scikits.learn, a Google Summer of Code project by David Cournapeau. Its name stems from the notion that it is a "SciKit" (SciPy Toolkit), a separately-developed and distributed third-party extension to SciPy.[4] The original codebase was later rewritten by other developers. In 2010 Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent Michel, all from INRIA took leadership of the project and made the first public release on February the 1st 2010.[5] Of the various scikits, scikit-learn as well as scikit-image were described as "well-maintained and popular" in November 2012.[6]

As of 2018, scikit-learn is under active development.(Source: Wikipedia.org)

## Getting started

# Installation

* If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy, the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using pip
pip install -U scikit-learn

or conda:
* conda install scikit-learn

After installation one can follow the below article to get a basic idea of sklearn
