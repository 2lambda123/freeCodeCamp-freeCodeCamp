**Sometimes you don't want to display the output of a certain command on console,but on a specific file.**

  **You can do this with the redirection of output.**
  
  ### Use "command > namefile.extension"
      
        Example: 'ls > my_file.txt'
      
  **This command create automatically a file named "my_file.txt" with the content of the output of command ls**
