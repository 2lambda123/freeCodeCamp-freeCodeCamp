## Customer Interviews

Customer Interviews - or User Interviews - are a good way to learn about the potential target group of your service or product. Furthermore you can also get feedback on services or products that you present to the potential user.

###Thinking out loud technique
One way to learn about a users feelings and impressions while using you product is to ask him / her to tell what he / she thinks while looking at it or using it. Hereby it's important that every little detail gets mentioned. For documentation reasons such interviews could be captured on camera. This will make it easier to re-evaluate the interview afterwards.
Also understand that user interviews ideally should not happen only one time but on a regular base while developing a product. This help to ensure your porduct really meets the needs of the users.
