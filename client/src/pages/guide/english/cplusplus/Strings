## STRINGS

In simp
le terms, a string is a collection of characters stored in continous memory locations. For eg- a name, a location,
an address or an introduction.

It may be a single character, a word or a complere story.

## DECLARATION

There are 2 ways to declare a string in C++.

1. A character type array - char <string name>[size]; 

2. A string type data type which was introduced in later versions of C++ -
string <name>; 

Note- Type 2 is not available in C and earlier versions of C++.

## NULL TERMINATION

Always remember that a string is always proceeded by a null character ('\0'). 
It is added by the compiler automatically at the end of the string. 

So always reserve an extra space for null character.

## INPUT AND OUTPUT

Here is a sample program to summarise input and output.

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
string s;

cout<<"Enter your name";
cin>>s;

cout<<endl<<"Hello, "<<s;
}
