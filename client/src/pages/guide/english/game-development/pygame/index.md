## Pygame

### Game Development with Pygame

Pygame is an open source, cross platform python library used for game development, written by Pete Shinners. The Pygame documentation and more information can be found on their website at https://pygame.org.

Pygame is very easy to use and i would suggest that if you want to develop games in Python, Pygame is the way to go. I have programmed many games and using pygame_sdl2 even have some packaged to android. Pygame is super simple and KIDSCANCODE on youtube is where i learnt how.
### Overview

The project started in the year 2000 as a result of the death of PySDL. The Pygame library version 1.0 was
released after six months development in April of 2001.
