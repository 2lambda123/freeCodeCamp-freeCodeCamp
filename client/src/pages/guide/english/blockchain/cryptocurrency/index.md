Cryptocurrency is a subset of digital currency, which acts as a medium of exchange amongst two parties. It is known as crypto-currency because of the utilization of cryptography in securing its transactions. Cryptocurrencies are implemented through a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a collection of distributed ledgers made immutable by the power of cryptography. In a blockchain each blocks are connected to each other in terms of hashes, which means that a new block contains hash of the previous block in it. And the hash of that block is determined by  its previous hash. So if you need to change information on a particular block, then you will have to alter all the blocks preceding it in a span of 10 minutes (for bitcoin), which is literally impossible. That's why Blockchains are called immutable and unhackable. There are various cryptocurrencies including LiteCoin, Dash, Ethereum, Ripple, and the currently most popular one Bitcoin. It is the perfect way to make trustless transactions since it does not involve any third party. 

Unlike normal currency, cryptocurrency can be exchanged as fractions. For example, transactions can amount to 0.00007 Btc or even lower.

If you want to earn bitcoins through mining, it can be done through solving mathematical proof-of-work problems that validate transactions (calculating that hash of that particular block). Hashing is not an easy task, because every hash has a difficulty level set into it, which narrows down the list of all possible hashes. Also timstamp is included in hashing, which means that every second the hash changes. So you must have a superfast computer for mining a block. Or in case of bitcoin, you could go for an ASIC (Application Specific integrated Circuits) for example Fast-Hash One or CoinTerra TerraMiner IV, which has centralised mining pools, which allows the participation of different miners and paying off in the ratio of their computational powers.
