## Introduction to jQuery

jQuery is one of the many libraries for JavaScript. It is designed to simplify scripting done on the client side.
jQuery's most recognizable characteristic is its dollar sign (<code>$</code>) syntax. With it, you can easily manipulate elements, create animations and handle input events.

## jQuery Plugins

jQuery is also expandable through plugins. You can create your own plugin. You check out their [plugin registry](in read-only mode) to see some of it for your inspiration and reference. You can also use any of those plugins for your projects for free. If you are planning to create and publish your own plugin they are suggesting to publish it on [npm] with a "jquery-plugin" keyword on your package.json. npm has a [blog post] for the instructions on publishing your jquery plugin to their registry.
