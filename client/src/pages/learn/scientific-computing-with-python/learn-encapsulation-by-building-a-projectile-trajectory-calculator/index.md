## Introduction to the Learn Encapsulation by Building a Projectile Trajectory Calculator

<!-- written with ChatGPT -->

Welcome to this project on understanding and implementing getters and setters in Python! Whether you're a beginner or have some experience with Python, this project will guide you through the concept and practical usage of getters and setters, essential components of object-oriented programming.

### What Are Getters and Setters?

In Python, getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the attributes of a class. These methods provide a way to encapsulate data, ensuring that the internal representation of the object's data is hidden from the outside. By using getters and setters, you can control how attributes are accessed and modified, adding an extra layer of security and robustness to your code.

- **Getters**: Methods that retrieve the value of an attribute.
- **Setters**: Methods that set or update the value of an attribute.

### Why Use Getters and Setters?

1. **Encapsulation**: By using getters and setters, you can hide the internal state of an object and only expose necessary parts. This helps in maintaining a clean and modular code structure.
2. **Validation**: Setters allow you to add validation logic to ensure that the values assigned to attributes are valid.
3. **Control**: Getters and setters provide control over how attributes are accessed and modified, making your code more maintainable and less prone to errors.
4. **Flexibility**: They allow you to change the internal implementation without affecting the external interface.

### Project Goals

In this project, you will:

1. Learn the syntax and usage of getters and setters in Python.
2. Understand the benefits of using getters and setters.
3. Implement getters and setters in a Python class.
4. Explore practical examples and scenarios where getters and setters are particularly useful.

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to use getters and setters in your Python programs, enabling you to write more secure, maintainable, and efficient code.

Let's dive into the world of getters and setters and see how they can enhance your Python programming skills!
