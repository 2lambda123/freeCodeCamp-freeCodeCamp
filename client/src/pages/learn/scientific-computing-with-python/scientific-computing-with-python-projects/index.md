## Introduction to the Scientific Computing with Python Projects

Time to put your Python skills to the test! By completing these projects, you will demonstrate that you have a good foundational knowledge of Python.

We are still working on Python instructional content in this curriculum to prepare you for these challenges. Until we finish this material, you can learn everything you need to complete the projects from these videos on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel:
 * [Python for Everybody Video Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI) (14 hours)
 * [Learn Python Video Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw) (4 hours)

In this section you will develop the following projects:
 * Arithmetic Formatter
 * Time Calculator
 * Budget App
 * Polygon Area Calculator
 * Probability Calculator

Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck-coding/19514) method if you get stuck.
