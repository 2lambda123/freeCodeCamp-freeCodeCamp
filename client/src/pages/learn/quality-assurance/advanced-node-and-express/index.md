## Introduction to Advanced Node and Express Challenges

_Authentication_ is the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process. Up to this point you have not been able to create an app utilizing this key concept.

The most common and easiest way to use authentication middleware for Node.js is [Passport](http://passportjs.org/). It is easy to learn, light-weight, and extremely flexible allowing for many _strategies_, which we will talk about in later challenges. In addition to authentication we will also look at template engines which allow for use of _Pug_ and web sockets which allow for real time communication between all your clients and your server.

Working on these challenges will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

- Clone <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this GitHub repo</a> and complete these challenges locally.
- Use <a href="https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true#https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">our Gitpod starter project</a> to complete these challenges.
- Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.
