## Introduction to Responsive Web Design

In today's world, every developer or customer, who is trying to build a website of their own, wants to design a single website that's going to look great on their desktop, mobile, tablet and all the other devices (who knows, even Apple Watch or Kindle). It's not practically efficient to design one website for each device and maintain the content correctly across them. To handle and take care of this problem, Responsive Web Design became the solution.

**What is Responsive Web design?**

> Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the userâ€™s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.

To make this possible, we create a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and a clever use of CSS `@media` queries. When a user switches from their laptop to iPad, or iPad to a mobile device, the website should automatically change its layout to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.
