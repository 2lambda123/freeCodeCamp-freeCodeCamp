## Introduction to the Coding Interview Take Home Projects

Programming interviews have always been stressful. One of the solutions is giving the applicant a take home project to be completed outside of the interview. These types of interviews usually require a lot of work, but it is the most preferred interviewing process.

The interview after the project submission could be a discussion about the applicant’s design decisions, scalability, and what the applicant might have done differently. This approach is more effective when the applicant doesn’t have a lot of publicly available past projects.

In this section you get the chance to work on many Take Home Projects like:
