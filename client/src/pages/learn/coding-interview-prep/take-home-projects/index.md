## Introduction to the Coding Interview Take Home Projects

Programming interviews have always been stressful. One of the solutions is giving the applicant a take home project which they can complete in their own time. These type of interviews usually require a lot of work but it is the most preferred interviewing process.

The interview after project submission could be a discussion about applicant’s design decisions, scalability, and what they might have done out of the box. This approach is more effective when the applicant doesn’t have a lot of publicly available past projects to talk about.
