## Introduction to the Coding Interview Prep Algorithms

These challenges are meant to teach and challenge you with common Algorithms that you will encounter in real life. Hopefully, these challenges will be a great learning experience and your programming and logical skills will improve.

In mathematics and computer science, an Algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ ) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.
In most of the coding interviews, foundation mostly means a clear understanding of basic 3data structures and Algorithms.

This course presents you with the most asked questions during the interviews to prepare your basic knowledge of Algorithms.
It will provide a clear and concise understanding and implementations of different Algorithms.

# Prerequisite: All the Algorithmic questions would require the solutions in Javascript. So, it's a good idea to complete the Javascript course first.

It's a very good practice to use a Whiteboard or a Notepad to implement and practice the interview questions, since most coding interviews use either a Whiteboard or a Notepad for writing the code. So forget your nice IDEs and debuggers and start getting your hands dirty.

# Best Of Luck !!
