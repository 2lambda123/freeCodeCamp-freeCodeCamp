// Requirements:
// - run in a single instance of pyodide (because loadPyodide is slow)
// - be able to stop execution of learner code
//
// This wrapper lets us meet the second requirement, since tasks are
// cancellable. This creates a second issue: the learner code no longer modifies
// the global scope, so we need to copy the locals to globals.
//
// Finally, we have to await the task, or there's no way for the JavaScript
// context to know when the task is complete.
